MESSAGE FROM MARNI:
You’re now part of a small group of guys who has exclusive access to the inside of a
woman’s head.
You’re about to learn the exact step-by-step process that will take her from being a total
stranger who could care less about you—to becoming fond of your presence, existing
eagerly with you in each moment, and adoring every minute she spends with you.
You’re about to discover the secrets to mastering the art of flirting with whomever you want,
wherever you want.
When you’re done with this program, you’ll be better at flirting than 99% of the guys you
know.
You’ll be able to ignite primal attraction with any woman you desire. You’ll know exactly how
to make any girl vie for your attention, and engage with you on a level most guys can’t even
detect—using our scientifically proven, rigorously tested and Wing Girl-Approved F
Formula. Sound good? Thought so.
Why Do You Need To Know How To Flirt?
Most girls won’t tell you this, but if you don’t know how to flirt (and how to tell when a woman
is flirting with you), you’ll never be able to communicate in ways that are attractive to her on
a gut level. It’s GAME OVER before you even get started.
Flirting is THAT essential to us girls. It’s the key to getting us swept up and carried away by
your natural charm. So do yourself a favor NOW and get this handled! Your future chick-
magnet self will thank you.
3
Now—You May Be Thinking,
“Marni, I Totally Know How To Flirt.”
But the truth is… you probably have no idea—and it’s not your fault.
Most guys who think they know how to flirt… don’t. And believe me—we can tell.
The few guys who DO figure it out on their own learn by complete accident. And even
then—they don’t know all the steps I’m about to lay out for you. This a master-level course ;)
As your Wing Girl, I’d never want YOU to creep girls out unknowingly. I KNOW you’re really
an attractive guy! Flirting simply helps you communicate that so she can see it more easily.
So here’s your first lesson on flirting. This is the REAL REASON most guys would never be
able to spark a cute girl’s attraction if their lives depended on it:
It’s because men and women have different definitions of flirting.
Typically, when a man flirts—or thinks of flirting—it involves something of a sexual nature.
But when a woman flirts—or thinks of flirting—she’s picturing a fun, playful, and exciting
banter that rarely includes anything sexual… well, at least not at first. ;)
In this program, I teach you how to flirt in the way women intuitively understand and respond
to.
The way that’ll have girls instantly smiling ear-to-ear when you talk to them… that get them
entranced and playfully engaged with you (and only you). With the F Formula, you can get a
girl hooked on you and take that interaction wherever you desire.
To get this right, you’ll need to go all the way through this program from beginning to
end. Each section is designed to be read (and watched) in the order it’s presented to you so
you can learn this material correctly.
By the time you complete this program, you’ll be able to:
1. Flirt with women using the F Formula—and seamlessly navigate through all three
levels of flirting: Initiation, Escalation, and Infatuation.
2. Spark and build attraction with ANY woman you desire to flirt with.
3. Understand the subtle, hidden signs women provide to let men know what they’re
REALLY thinking.
You’re going to hear directly from women about why they flirt, who they want to flirt with, and
who they AVOID flirting with like the plague (hint: it’s NOT who you think).
And not only that—you’ll have a total blast learning all this stuff in the process!
But let me warn you: You won’t get good at flirting just by reading this book and watching
the videos. That’s only part of the process.
4
You’ve GOT to go out and take action on this material—if you don’t do that, you’ll miss out
on a vital part of this comprehensive program, and you won’t develop the woman-captivating
flirting skills you just invested your hard-earned cash to acquire!
That’s why throughout this book you’ll receive mandatory exercises you MUST do if you
want to see results. I won’t accept any refund requests if you haven’t applied and tried out
this amazing information. Applying what you’ve learned, failing, and getting back at it is what
makes this stuff work! Just like AA ;)
Before We Dive Into The F-Formula…
In this program we impart to you The Wing Girl Method’s kick ass, strikingly powerful
method for flirting with and magnetizing any women you want. And I need you to make me a
HUGE promise right here before we move any further…
I want you to promise me you’ll only use what I’m about to teach you for good and not for
evil. That means you’ll NEVER use the F Formula to manipulate or lead women on. I know
you’re a great guy, but I would simply kick myself if I didn't state that disclaimer.
So if you agree to use this product with good intentions only, then you’re free to continue
reading!
Without further ado! Let’s start with introducing you the wonderful woman who wrote this
book… MARISSA! I’ll let her take over from here 
Hope to flirt with you shortly!
I’m Marissa!
Hi!!!!! I’m Marissa and I’m so excited to teach you how to flirt. I
have been on both the receiving end and giving end of flirting.
And that means I am a master flirter who has seen it all.
Which means, you are in good hands ;-)
In order for you to get the BEST results out of this program, I
ask that you follow this practice. Read, take in, practice and
tweak.
This is a new skill for you and remembering that it’s going to take time, possible
failure and LOTS of practice to hone is a must know. You aren’t magically going to
5
know how to be a master in the art of flirting by simply reading this book. If that
principal were too I’d be able to beat Serena Williams after just watching 1 of her
matches and reading a book on tennis.
Give yourself 30 – 60 days of solid practice with this material. Take your time
reading and watching and practicing and take notice of the strides you take.
I’ve tried to make this program as easily digestible as possible and I have included
honing exercises for each phase of the formula. My belief on exercises is very similar
to Marni’s belief. Before you build a “muscle” you need to do some exercises first.
Exercises help build up that muscle into a strong, solid bulge ;-)
I’ve included my own first hand experiences and stories to give you examples of
flirting gone bad and the results GOOD flirting can get you. These examples are
meant to show you an honest, female POV on flirting. Don’t get mad at my
examples. Learn, practice and hone instead.
One more little note before I dive into the F Formula. This program assumes that
you have a basic understanding and ownership of a strong masculine disposition. IF
you don’t feel that you have that foundation down, I highly recommend getting a
copy of How To Become A Man Women Want and then coming back to this product.
Get a copy here: http://www.winggirlmethod.com/special/htb/020/
I created the F Formula after I started working with Marni a few years ago and with
her help I am sharing it with you today. If at any point you get confused, have
questions or are not sure how to apply what you have learned, please feel free to
contact me.
As with any product from The Wing Girl Method you have a week of free email
coaching that begins on your first day of purchase.

Chapter 1: The 6 Essential Flirting Tools
Summary: What You’re About To Learn
1. Flirting Definition: Flirting is adult play.
• It allows you to grab her attention and engage her.
• It gives you an opportunity to display your attractive qualities while keeping her
interested
• If you’re having fun and showing intent, you’re flirting.
2. The Six Basic Flirting Strategies
• #1: Proper Eye Contact
• A real man can look her in the eye without flinching.
• It’s not a big deal—don’t stare creepily.
• Sexy eye contact is SUBTLE.
• “I know you want me, but let’s pretend we both don’t notice it.”
• #2: Cultivating A Good Smile
• Many times when guys smile, it can seem try-hard and needy.
• The best kind of smile is a half-smile (smirk). It communicates all the
right attractive things.
• Practice your smirk and use in conjunction with proper eye contact.
• #3: Being Masculine
• Active masculinity is what creates attraction, so she can feel feminine in
your presence.
• Assume it’s your responsibility to initiate and move the interaction
forward
• Accept each rejection and don’t let it affect you emotionally.
• Own your masculinity by taking action.
• #4: Proper Body Language
• Eliminate all nervous, stilted, or unconfident body language.
• Project a relaxed confidence.
• Sitting: Take up space, make your legs incongruent. Don’t lean.
• Standing: Plant your legs in the same place, and shift your weight more
onto one leg than the other.
• Walking: Do it slowly. Keep a little tension in your hands.
• Relax your shoulders. Keep all tension out of them.
• #5: Be Open With Your Intentions
• Do not cover up that you are attracted or potentially interested in a
woman
7
• Hiding your intentions gives you a direct pass to friendship land
• #6: Flirt With Everyone NOT Just Women!
• Flirting is a tool for connecting with and entertaining people in general.
• Learn to be open with EVERYONE, and entertain them by sparking their
attention.
• This will help you flirt with girls, and also enjoy your life a lot more in
general.
Let’s define what flirting actually IS first to make sure we’re all on the same page.
There are many different definitions of flirting—but for the purpose of this program and the
well being of your sex life… we’ll say flirting is defined as adult play. It’s a lively, stimulating
mix of teasing, challenging, sexuality—and most importantly—FUN.
Flirting allows you to:
1. Grab her attention so she engages with you from the beginning of the interaction.
2. Discover which women are already into you.
3. Evaluate and select the women you like.
4. Create huge opportunities to escalate the interaction with girls quickly (and in
ways they’re TOTALLY excited about).
5. Showcase all your desirable qualities.
6. Access her attraction for you, and use it as leverage to make her comply.
Flirting is your CALLING CARD as a man. It’s your “in.” It allows you to test the waters with a
girl, feel out a situation, and progress forward from there. Eventually, it’ll give you access to
her heart, soul, and body—in ways most men will never understand.
How Do I Know When I’m Flirting?
It’s simple. When you’re interacting with a girl, are you showing intent? Are you having fun?
If you answered YES to both of those questions… then yes, you’re flirting.
If, on the other hand you find yourself holding back, editing yourself and closing yourself off,
then you are NOT flirting.
Some examples of how to show intent are as follows:
Physically: Touch, standing close to her, sitting close to her, soft eye contact vs. avoiding
any type of physical contact, patting her in stiff manner, sitting or standing far away from her
out of fear of scaring her away or potentially being called an attacker.
8
You will know if you are physically showing intent if your actions are in line with what it is you
want from her. If in your head you’re thinking “I’m attracted to her and want to take her out”
but you are standing far away from her, making no eye contact and little touching, then you
are not in line with your intent.
Verbal: Using direct words to say and ask for what you want that is in line with your intent
“I’ve enjoyed talking with you and would like to do this again. What are you doing next
Friday? I’d like to take you out on a date.” Or “I love Tapas as well. In fact there is this
awesome place right by my house that just opened up. Why don’t I take you there next
week and we can talk more about the things we have in common.” Or “You know you’re
cute when you laugh.” Vs. “Great meeting. Maybe I’ll see you around sometime.” OR “We
should go out sometime.”
You will know if you are showing verbal intent if your words get a response from the woman
that tell you what her intention is. Example “No. I have a boyfriend. But thanks for asking.”
Or “I’d love to go out with you next week.” Or “I’m busy next Friday but I’m free on
Saturday.”
You don’t have to be funny to flirt—and you certainly don’t need to ooze sex. The only skill
you need is the ability to be open to whatever comes your way by creating fun and delight
for both of you—WITHOUT getting attached to the results.
This means at the core, you have to be truly comfortable in your own skin, and…
Own Who You Are!
Flirting is playfulness for the sake of play and doesn’t have to signal anything sexual. The
first level of flirting is simply a way of showcasing your best qualities and pulling people into
you. It can and SHOULD be done with EVERYONE… NOT just one person. It allows you to
be open and create a space to cast a wider net, so you can safely select the girl you want to
advance with.
Then you can seamlessly transform your initial innocent, playful flirting into devious, sexual
flirting that sends you both on an intoxicating adventure—and primes your interaction for the
bedroom.
And to be clear: if a woman ever shows signs she DOESN’T want to escalate with you—
back off. Never force it. That’s a huge no-no and in some circumstances could land you in
jail—not to mention, it repels women.
Soon you’ll learn how to evaluate and gauge like a scientist whether a woman is picking up
what you’re laying down, so you’ll know EXACTLY when to move forward and when to back
off.

Now that we’ve established what flirting is, let’s move on to…
The Basics: 6 Essential Flirting Tools
Let’s take 5 minutes to go over what tools you need in your tool belt to properly flirt.
These are the Six Basic Tools you MUST HAVE in order to flirt correctly. Though they might
seem basic, they’re extremely essential, and you’ll be pulling on these core tools throughout
the rest of the material.
So remember: This is the foundation. Get these handled before you move on!
Tool # 1: Proper Eye Contact
This is the MOST fundamental part of flirting—if you don’t know how to do it right, it’ll be an
immediate NO from the girl before you ever say a word to her.
In just one second, eye contact communicates literally hundreds of bits of information about
you and how you feel about yourself. Girls pick up on this both consciously and
unconsciously—and it determines how we feel about you.
First, you’ve got to make eye contact in the first place. A real man can look a woman in
the eye without flinching. You can be more ripped than Arnold in his prime and have more
money than Richard Branson… but if you can’t even make eye contact with a girl, it’s an
immediate NO.
Below are some examples of HORRIBLE eye contact that would creep me out and
immediately signal to me I should NOT be talking to this man:
A is too smiley, B is a serial killer, C is trying too hard, and D is just plain slimy and gross.
He’ll never get to use his tongue on me in a MILLION years. Ew.
10
Okay, maybe these a little over the top BUT these images show you how a woman
interprets bad eye contact and staring. Just the other day, I was at the valet waiting for my
car and this guy kept looking at me. Dead eye contact, no smile and looked me up and
down and up and down and up and down. Never taking notice of ME. It was like he was in
his own world just looking and thinking things I don’t even want to know. It was creepy and
it made me want to run and hide.
Eye contact like I am describing signals to us girls you’re unsafe for us to be with—and that
sets off our internal “creep” alarm!
Okay—enough about creepy vibes.
Now let’s talk about the PERFECT type of eye contact. The kind that gets us girls so
excited we’re simply dying to know who you are before you ever say a word.
Just like flirting in general, it’s done on a much more subtle level.
It usually consists of 5-7 seconds of soft but direct eye contact before you slowly break away
and then come back. The pictures below are a perfect example of this type of eye contact:
If you need more help, check out a video I created on YouTube that shows you an example
of good initial eye contact: (See Marni explain how to make eye contact in the bonus
video section. Title: How To Make Good Eye Contact)
Now here’s a quick exercise you can do to get down your sexiest face:
For the next week, look in the mirror for 5 minutes every night and think to yourself : “I know
you want me but let’s pretend we both don’t notice it.”
Say it in your head or even out loud. Notice the expression your face automatically and
naturally makes when you think (and FEEL) that thought. This is the face you want to
master.
It’s the “We’re going to get into so much trouble together” face. THAT’S the face you want.
That face will enable you to make girls MELT just by looking at them. OWN that face, so you
can unleash it when the time is appropriate.
11
Tool #2: Cultivating A Good Smile (Smirk)
For a girl, being “smiled” at by a man who owns it is the best feeling in the entire world!!!!
The smile is the heart of the face. It tells a woman everything she needs to know about him.
And the BEST kind of smile, or “flirting smile,” is a SMIRK.
A smirk is where only half of your mouth is smiling. If you look back at the photo examples
above, you’ll see some excellent examples of smirks.
Studies have shown that men who “over-smile” or have smiles that are too big send a
message to women that they’re needy, approval seeking, and disingenuous.
The smirk, on the other hand, is a little mysterious and tells women you have exactly the
type of confidence she’s looking for. It says, “Hey—I’m playing with you and KNOW you
can’t resist me!”
Here are few more for reference as well as some No’s No’s for smiles.
No, No’s:
I’m not saying that smiling this way is the kiss of death. What I am saying is that when you
are trying to put your sexual, flirty intentions out there, smiles like this don’t express that.
They express safe, nice, kind…. All good things that you want to mix in with your awesome
smirks and sexy glances. A full interaction with the smiles above will not express what it is
you want.
12
GOOD SMIRKS!!!!!
So help me if you say “But that’s George Clooney. He’ll look good doing anything.” Yes,
that’s kind of true but it’s not the reason I showed these pictures. I am showing them to you
because Clooney is amazing at the smirk.
You’ll want to bring out your smirk not only when you’re first making eye contact—but any
time you tease or play with her throughout the interaction.
(See Marni explain how to smirk in the bonus video section. Title: How To Smile At
Women and Make Them Want You)
Quick exercise for getting your smirk-game down:
Step 1: Go watch any George Clooney movie and watch how to smirk at women
Step 2: Go sit in front of your mirror and practice doing that same smirk, but obviously give
your own spin to it. Do this for 1 week.
Step 3: Find 3 females (co-workers, friends, sister) and ask them what your smirk says to
them
Step 4: Go out and smirk at 10 women a day. Hold the smirk for 2 seconds and then look
away and then look back. (this is to get you comfortable with holding your intent and being
proud of it and then being strong enough to let go)
BONUS: Want to see if you have nailed that super sexy smile? You can send me either
pictures or a video of yourself doing the smile and I will tell you if it’s right OR if you need to
make tweaks. You can sign up for my email-coaching program by clicking here for just
$1 for the first 7 days.
If you’ve already done the eye contact exercise in the mirror, you probably also started to
see your smirk appear naturally. Each time you do this exercise, make sure and check in
that your smirk is there also. See it. Remember it. Bring it out when talking to a woman.
Smirking may not seem natural now, but just like any new skill, you can learn to incorporate
it more often. Once your natural instinct is to smirk when you see a woman that you like,
13
you’ll start getting a lot of attention back, and (hopefully) a lot more great interactions,
numbers and dates with the women you want. You will have mastered the first step to
becoming a more attractive man.
Tool #3: Touch
Touch is the best way to either creep a woman out, engage her, or send pulses of
excitement throughout her body—depending on how you do it. It's an essential part of
proper flirting, so you HAVE to know where, when, and for how long to touch her!
Right from the very beginning of your interaction, you can touch her on the shoulder, the
arm above the elbow, or the upper back area. If you linger too long with your touch, it can
come off as creepy—so don’t do it for more than a second or two while you're talking to her.
Touch her at a time when it makes sense; in other words, touch her shoulder when you find
a commonality, make a connection, or laugh at a joke. Do it sparingly and sporadically in the
beginning. If you overdo this it can lose its effectiveness or come off as creepy.
Initiate touch as SOON as possible. If you've been talking with a girl for an hour, then you try
to touch her with the first time, she can interpret that as weird or creepy—it often times
comes off incongruent with how you had been acting. Your best bet is to show her you're the
type of guy who is comfortable with touch from the first moment you meet her.
Eye contact in combination with touch is POWERFUL. When you make eye contact with a
girl, it can feel a lot like you physically entered into her personal space, and touch can
amplify that feeling, so be mindful and don’t overdo it at the beginning.
Once you escalate flirting and have gained more rapport with her, you can use heavy eye
contact in combination with touch for a powerful gut-level attraction in the woman you’re
talking to--but only after you've escalated with her. You'll learn a lot more on how to escalate
touch later on.
For now—get the essentials down. Remember when, where, and for how long you can
touch her for just the right amount of sexual tension when you’re flirting.
(See Marni explain how to touch without being creepy in the bonus video section.
Title: 5 Tips on The Art of Touching A Woman)
14
Tool #4: Open Body Language
Good body language and actions are at least five times more important in an interaction with
a woman than what you say. Statistically 85% of the communication we pay attention to
happens without saying a single word.
Us girls put guys into “yes—no—maybe” categories within the first few seconds, before you
even approach. And when you have these two areas down, you can exponentially multiply
your chances of her being receptive to you when you approach.
There’s an unconscious level where we “catch” each other’s vibes. If your body language is
nervous and tense, the girl you’re talking to will feel nervous and tense, and she won’t know
why. She’ll just get nervous, and realize her nervousness started when you approached her.
So she’ll think you’re creepy.
The #1 key to avoiding this, and making your body language sexy is to REMAIN OPEN with
your body language and own it. I’ve included some visual examples so you can see what I
am talking about when I say being OPEN with your body language and owning it.
To be open, don’t close yourself off. Relax your shoulders. Keep your arms at your sides.
Keep eye contact. Keep your hands out of your pockets. Take big strides.
Any time you're “going in on yourself” with your body language, i.e., fidgeting, touching
yourself, even talking about or thinking about yourself in the interaction (which can subtly
show up in your body language), you’re closing yourself off more.
15
Instead of paying attention to yourself, pay attention to everyone else in the room and think
about how you can add value to them. Your body language will dramatically improve as a
result of taking the focus off of yourself. You’ll be naturally open, with an air of masculinity.
When you have open body language, men will interpret it as trustworthy; women interpret it
as attractive.
Think of it this way. Girls ALWAYS know what’s going on. If you’re uncomfortable and
nervous about approaching, we know it. If you like us but haven’t approached, we can tell.
I’ll let a guy talk himself out of it before I make the first move. Even if I really like him.
Sure, I’ll be disappointed he didn’t gather the courage to come talk to me… but not so
disappointed I’ll do it myself. If you can’t be the one to start and lead the interaction, then
you’re just not what us girls are looking for.
And here’s why: We want to feel your masculinity so WE can feel feminine in your
presence.
There’s a polarity of tension that’s created when YOU are being active and masculine with
US being passive and feminine. This is what creates our attraction for you! So if WE
approach YOU… that kills it completely.
After you approach, assume that you have to keep the bulk of it going in the beginning. She
may contribute more and help steer the interaction, she may not—but simply showing that
you’re willing to carry the conversation is hot and sexy! It's MASCULINE!
Don’t get discouraged if she “shoots down” anything you initiate—whether it’s a
conversation, a suggestion to go somewhere, a kiss, or sex. Own it, stay strong and make
sure your body language shows that you can take it.
Accept each rejection and don’t be swayed by it—and never become overly aggressive.
Be totally fine with each rejection (even laugh at it – just don’t scoff!). The message you
want to send to a woman during a “rejection” is this: “It’s okay if you don’t want me. Others
do and you may change your mind once you see how I respond.”
Side Note: A few examples of how to handle it with class and awesomeness.
Her: “I have a boyfriend”
You: “lucky man. If you ever find yourself single, let me know”
You: “Are you calling me your boyfriend already?? Slow down lady” smirk on your face and
then moving onto a new conversation
You: “Got it. So you are taken but I’m sure a woman like you has some cute friends she can
introduce me to. Typically high quality women run in the same circles so any introduction
would be appreciated.”
16
All of these are a different tone BUT what they are really saying is that you put it out there
but aren’t wounded by the NO.
Look at the body language and behaviors of guys in movies who are in control. These guys
usually not the ones with the biggest muscles. They are open. They look relaxed in their
own skin. They make larger gestures. They’re comfortable. Emulate them.
When you show people you’re open, you value yourself by taking initiative and being
confident, and you’re at ease with the world, it registers unconsciously to people that you’re
a high-value person… and girls will be DYING to talk to you!
(Check out Marni’s guide to confident body language in the bonus section)
Tool #5: Be Open About Your Intentions
Every time I say this to a client they are shocked and usually say something like this: “I can’t
just let a girl know that I like her. That’s creepy!” To which I usually respond “So you are
saying it’s better to sit back and pretend you don’t want her and act like a bland, polite,
boring, FRIENDLY guy that doesn’t want to see if the 2 of you have chemistry???? You
keep doing that and see where it gets you.”
Men who are successful with women and great flirts have no concerns about putting what
they want out there. Doesn’t mean, that when you see an attractive women you MAY want
to date, that you immediately go up to her, grab her and say I want to do you and then start
humping her leg. I mean, that may work sometimes but most often that’s too forward ;-)
It means not covering up that you think she is attractive and want to know more about her.
There is nothing wrong with having an interest or an attraction to a woman. It’s not rude,
aggressive and disrespectful.
What is rude is pretending you don’t want anything from this woman while secretly falling in
love her and then revealing it to her 3 months later.
I want to give you an intention that will help you be more comfortable when talking to
women. The intention is that you because you find her attractive, you’re going to talk to her
in a flirty manner and see if that attraction continues. IF it does, you’ll invest further a.k.a ask
for her number, ask her out, and flirt more.
No more covering up what you want! It will never get you the results you want.
Which leads me to our last basic principle of flirting.
17
Tool #6: Flirt With Everyone NOT Just Women!
Don’t misunderstand this tool. I’m NOT advising you to start hitting on men just to hone this
new skill. Remember what I said previously. Flirting DOESN’T have to be sexual and the
first phase of the F Formula is far from sexual. It’s PLAYFUL and open.
Do you know how sexy it is to be out for a night and look over and see a guy being open,
fun and playful. Even if he’s just with his guy friends. It’s awesome. That type of behavior is
what pulls us women in and makes us think “I want to hang out with them”.
Moving forward, you want to open yourself up to everyone you can. So that when a woman
comes along that you find attractive, your playful, fun muscle has already been well warmed
up and ready to go. PLUS it’s good PR for you. Those observing the great, open guy will
be eager to know more.
Once you master the F Formula, it will be your duty to flirt with ALL KINDS of people. Not
just beautiful women, but older ladies, store clerks, even GUYS. Certain levels of flirting
equate to simply having fun, being open and bringing people in to your sphere. It does not
have to include sex, sexuality or any type of attraction.
Flirting with everyone will QUADRUPLE your understanding of flirting from the female point
of view, and skyrocket your success rate with women.
Remember when I said men and women have different definitions of flirting?
For women, flirting is not exclusively a sexual activity. In the best selling book The Female
Brain” Louann Brizendine, writes:
“Men have two and a half times the brain space devoted to sexual drive as women. Sexual
thoughts float through a man’s brain many times each day on average. Much less through a
woman’s. Women can interact with men in a friendly manner without any sexual thoughts
floating around in their brain.”
Biologically, men are programmed to view most interactions with the opposite sex as sexual
interactions, whereas women do not. This results in a disconnect between how we
communicate with one another—especially in the initial part of the interaction.
The truth is, flirting can be a tool for connecting and entertaining people in general. It’s
NOT only for getting sexual.
So start to perceive flirting the way women do—a fun way of connecting with people,
making them laugh and feel good about themselves, and NOT inherently sexual.
18
This way, the concept of flirting applies to a much broader spectrum of people—you may
already flirt with your guy friends and not even know it!
You can gain a HUGE advantage over most guys by being open with EVERYONE and
learning how to spark their attention and engage them. Taking this view on flirting will not
only help you with women, it’ll also help you enjoy your life and interactions with PEOPLE
much, much more.
Now, of course flirting can turn very sexual.
For the rest of the program I’m going to show you exactly how to weave irresistible sexual
attraction into your flirting.
Now that you have your 6 essential tools to become a master flirter it’s time to finish up this
chapter so that we can get to Chapter 2: Mistakes Men Make When Flirting
19
Chapter 1: Review of What You Learned
3. Flirting Definition: Flirting is adult play.
• It allows you to grab her attention and engage her.
• It gives you an opportunity to display your attractive qualities while keeping her
interested
• If you’re having fun and showing intent, you’re flirting.
4. The Six Basic Flirting Strategies
• #1: Proper Eye Contact
• A real man can look her in the eye without flinching.
• It’s not a big deal—don’t stare creepily.
• Sexy eye contact is SUBTLE.
• “I know you want me, but let’s pretend we both don’t notice it.”
• #2: Cultivating A Good Smile
• Many times when guys smile, it can seem try-hard and needy.
• The best kind of smile is a half-smile (smirk). It communicates all the
right attractive things.
• Practice your smirk and use in conjunction with proper eye contact.
• #3: Being Masculine
• Active masculinity is what creates attraction, so she can feel feminine in
your presence.
• Assume it’s your responsibility to initiate and move the interaction
forward
• Accept each rejection and don’t let it affect you emotionally.
• Own your masculinity by taking action.
• #4: Proper Body Language
• Eliminate all nervous, stilted, or unconfident body language.
• Project a relaxed confidence.
• Sitting: Take up space, make your legs incongruent. Don’t lean.
• Standing: Plant your legs in the same place, and shift your weight more
onto one leg than the other.
• Walking: Do it slowly. Keep a little tension in your hands.
• Relax your shoulders. Keep all tension out of them.
• #5: Be Open With Your Intentions
• Do not cover up that you are attracted or potentially interested in a
woman
• Hiding your intentions gives you a direct pass to friendship land
• #6: Flirt With Everyone NOT Just Women!
20
• Flirting is a tool for connecting with and entertaining people in general.
• Learn to be open with EVERYONE, and entertain them by sparking their
attention.
• This will help you flirt with girls, and also enjoy your life a lot more in
general.
Chapter 2: Mistakes Men Make
When Flirting
Summary: What You’re About To Learn
1. Guys’ Two Biggest Flirting Road Blocks
• There are two extremes most guys who need help with this fall into:
• The PAL: The guy who never takes any risks, overanalyzes, doesn’t
initiate anything, and is afraid he’ll scare the woman off if he conveys
interest or says something sexual. He ends up in the friend zone.
• The PERV: The guy who takes TOO much uncalibrated action, doesn’t
judge the situation around him, and is too aggressive. He ends up being
labeled a creep.
• There are two types of forces you need to balance out in order to avoid being a
Pal or a Perv:
• Active Forces:
• Focused initiative to move the interaction forward.
• Showing your intent.
• Showing your confidence and healthy entitlement.
• Initiating kissing, sex, touch, etc.
• Too many active forces, when unbalanced, make you a Perv.
• Passive Forces:
• Acceptance of your environment and detachment from
outcome.
• Objective judgment of the social environment around you.
• Listening to what the girl has to say.
21
• Knowing how to earn her trust.
• Too many passive forces, when unbalanced, make you a Pal.
• Finding the just right balance between Perv and Pal is called the Goldilocks
Zone. It’s where female attraction is found, and it’s where you want to stay
throughout your flirting escalation.
• This means that proper flirting is a constant balance of Active and
Passive Forces.
As I told you before, I’ve been in the “flirting game” for a good number of years and I’ve seen
men make MANY MANY MANY mistakes that could easily be avoided if they had been
given a little guidance.
Mistakes have included 1 or many of the following:
1. Not showing intent/not taking initiative (the Pal which I’ll explain in a bit)
2. Not knowing how to *smoothly* transition an interaction from topical to flirtatious.
As in, the guy comes up to me in Whole Foods and starts a conversation about (say) the
goat cheese in my basket and then talks my ear off about all the variations of cheese for 15
minutes and then says “gotta go” because he doesn’t know how to transition the
conversation to create connection or heightened flirtation (this is a HUGE problem for many
guys and will be covered extensively in Chapter 3)
3. Being All Banter All The Time
There is nothing more off putting than the constant clown. I’ve had so many guys approach
me with some quick, witty banter that I love and pulls me. BUT then they can’t get off the
banter and get serious. I’m not talking about discussing politics and the meaning of life. I’m
referring to when I ask him a simple question and he can’t stop giving me quick one liners.
Banter is fun but it’s not conducive for escalating a flirtation after initiation.
4. Not Owning Who You Are
I’ve seen this happen SO many times with guys. They self edit to appease ME. But they
don’t even know me yet. So how can they know what I want or what I don’t like. They self
edit to the point of coming across as bland and dull. No opinions. No position on
ANYTHING. Just a complete flat line of personality, which is simply not attractive.
When you don’t own who you are you completely stop yourself from projecting any type of
attractive masculine energy. Instead us women tend to see you as too friendly, NICE, eager,
needy, nervous, or even high strung.
22
5. Putting Her On A Pedestal!
Why the hell would I want to be a on pedestal especially when that pedestal is based on
nothing I value. Talk to me for a bit and then you can tell me how awesome I am ;-)
The moment you put her ahead of you, is the moment you lose her and yourself. Dating,
mating and flirting is all about creating connection for the potential (sex, relationship,
marriage etc.…) No one wants to do any of those things with someone they don’t respect or
value.
Remember that you are part of this decision process too and therefore need to evaluate and
screen based on your needs NOT hers.
6. Coming On Too Strong (the Perv which I’ll explain in a minute)
7. Not Paying Attention To How She Responds To You
This is heavily covered in the program and is THE core principal behind The F Formula.
8. Being Too Creepy
To be honest, most of these things come across as creepy. So “being too creepy” is the
result rather than just a mistake. Men become creepy when they fail to take notice of the
woman they are interacting with and create a boundary/distance/wall/disconnect through
any of the mistakes listed above.
This inconsistency and lack of awareness is simply defined as creepy. Because that’s how it
feels to women. It just feels creepy.
Two Biggest Flirting Road Blocks
Through my time as a Wing Girl, and as just a normal girl that gets hit on, I’ve identified two
categories most guys who need help with flirting fall into.
Figuring out which one you lean more toward will reveal to you what you need to pay special
attention to through the rest of this program. So pay special attention to the descriptions
below and be honest about what category you fall info.
IF you don’t know, ask people. Ask your friends, your past dates, your mom…. ANYONE
that you can get an honest answer from.
If you can identify which category you will fall into it will be easier for me to show you how to
create a personalized road map based on your unique strengths and drawbacks— to
creating sexy, captivating flirting behavior no matter what’s tripping you up currently!
23
The Pal Category
These are the guys who NEVER flirt. They say they’re not good at it, they don’t get positive
responses from women, they hate rejection, and it’s just WORK for them to connect with
girls.
These guys choose to be passive instead of active. They don’t show their masculine
qualities to women (basic flirting strategy #3). They passively assess what’s going on
around them TOO much—to the point where they’re overanalyzing. Even if a girl seems to
like them, they won’t initiate flirting or anything remotely sexual out of fear it’ll offend her or
scare her away.
So they hold back on stating their intentions…, which lands them directly in the friendship
lane. If you find yourself getting the “let’s just be friends” speech, you’re probably too
passive, and need to balance yourself out with ACTIVE forces.
The Perv Category
Sorry for the name but it’s how these guys come across because of their actions. These
guys are the opposite—they DO try putting themselves out there, but come on WAY too
strong. They’re uncalibrated, don’t read her signals, get too aggressive, and end up insulting
girls or scaring them off.
They haven’t balanced out their action-taking qualities with willing acceptance and objective
judgment of the situation around them (or—they haven’t learned how to read and respond to
her signals in order to calibrate adequately).
If you find women get cold quickly, make excuses to exit the conversation giving you a
dismissive tap on the shoulder, or if you’ve ever been labeled creepy, this is probably you.
You’re too active, and need to balance that out with PASSIVE forces.
The Forces Explained
24
Too much of anything is never a good thing. Even if it’s a chocolate fudge Sunday with
marshmallows on top. Eventually that yummy goodness is going to make you want to puke.
That’s why balance is essential. Not just with your snacks but also with women.
And there is nothing women like more than a good snack mixed well balanced man ;-)
I want to dive a little more into these forces that I talked about because maintaining their
balance is a major component for success in flirting.
Examples Of PASSIVE Forces:
- Objective judgment: reading the girl’s verbal and nonverbal cues, being socially aware of
your surroundings, getting feedback from your environment so you can calibrate your
actions.
- Conversation threading where you show that you are actively listening to what she is
saying and then sharing your own experiences.
- Willing acceptance: Being completely okay with what’s going on around you and how the
girl responds—even if it’s not the outcome you wanted.
- Authentically listening to what the girl has to say so you can have a deeper conversation.
- Letting loose and displaying your personality.
- Knowing how to earn her trust.
When passive forces aren’t balanced with active forces, that’s when you become a PAL.
Examples Of ACTIVE Forces:
- Focused initiative—the ability to approach her, willingness to lead the conversation and
move the interaction forward. Being BOLD.
- Displaying your confidence by showing you have a healthy sense of entitlement. Trusting
in yourself and your actions 100%
25
- The ability to say slightly socially risky things, like subtle sexual innuendos (just make sure
you calibrate them with Passive Forces), or show your offbeat sense of humor with
someone you just met.
- Initiating touch, kissing, sex, etc.
- Your ability to deliver what’s needed in each moment to move the interaction forward.
When you have too many active forces and they’re not balanced with passive forces, that’s
when you become a PERV.
Now—you might predominantly fall into one of these two extremes, or if you’re like some
guys, you’ve experienced a little bit of both. Either way, have no fear. The remedy is simple:
All you need to do to fix this this is find the right balance between active and passive
forces
The Goldilocks Zone
Finding that “just-right” balance of active and
passive forces is where the magic lies. This
is what we’re going to call “The Goldilocks
Zone.” Your #1 goal when you’re flirting is to
ALWAYS be aware of where The Goldilocks Zone lies.
This information can be represented on the chart to the left. As you increase attraction, you’ll
need to constantly balance your active and passive forces to stay in the Goldilocks Zone as
much as possible.
This means before you use an Active Force—like going to touch her—you need to balance it
out with a Passive Force, like a little bit of meaningful conversation or joking/teasing.
26
By the end of the F Formula, you’ll gain control of this chart and harness its hidden power—
you’ll be able to attract her—and take that attraction in whichever direction you desire! ;)

Now that we’re done reviewing, it’s time to start the REAL fun and dive into The F Formula!
I’m excited for you. The F-Formula was created based on nearly a decade of research of
observing, questioning, and testing beautiful girls of ALL kinds. We studied, probed, and
examined thousands of women for this. Most of them didn’t even know they were under the
microscope!
This formula is based on the fact that we women are on a constant emotional roller coaster
of emotions. We feel so much more than you do and more extremely. Our feelings are
constantly fluctuating from moment to moment and because of this, we require more
stimulus to catch our attention and make us FEEL something about you.
The F-Formula uses information this to keep women on their toes while making them
increasingly interested in YOU.
So read on and immerse yourself in this knowledge—pretty soon, you’ll wonder why you
ever thought it was so difficult to get the girls you desire to be enamored with you.
28
Chapter 3: WHAT IS THE F FORMULA?
Summary: What You’re About To Learn
• The F Formula Phases:
1. Initiation - Make initial contact and assess your attraction to one another.
2. Escalation - Spend time with her, evaluate the progression, and raise her desire
for you.
3. Infatuation - Become more directly sexual, build her desire, and create lasting
attraction.
• You MUST ascend the phases in order. Doing so out of order will make you come
across as a creepy Perv.
• You’ll ramp up her attraction by bouncing back to previous I.E.I or Cold, Warm and HOT
Phases and keeping it unpredictable.
• In each Phase, you'll have Four Goals to reach:
Goal A: Correctly display your intent
Goal B: Earn her trust
Goal C: Create desire for you within her
Goal D: Decode her female cues to assess that she’s positively responding.
• In order to move to each next Phase, ALL of these goals need to have been completed.
If you try to move to the next Phase and she backs off, one or more of these goals
29
hasn’t been completed.
• What you do to achieve each goal will look different depending on the Phase you’re in.
• At the end of Phase 3, you will have balanced out Active and Passive Forces so she
thinks and feels everything she needs to so she’s ready to comply with your requests to
have an unforgettable time together.
The F Formula is the formula created after years of flirting and analyzing what type of flirting
other women respond to. I didn’t just throw this formula together. This formula has been
scientifically proven to work by 1000’s of women. Some of which you can see in the F
Formula video located in the bonus section.
The F Formula is composed of 3 Phases:
Phase 1: Initiation - Think of this phase as cold with potential to become warm
Phase 2: Escalation – Think of this phase as warm with potential to become HOT!!!
Phase 3: Infatuation – Think of this phase as HOT HOT HOT with potential for whatever
you want ;-)
I.E.I. for short… OR if it’s easier for you to visualize: Cold, Warm, And HOT!
30
These Phases serve as a linear guideline for you. By always knowing which Phase you’re
in, you’ll be able to calibrate your flirting—so you’ll always know what she needs in order for
you to escalate with her to more intimacy without coming off as a Pal or a Perv.
I.E.I. Phases Explained (Cold. Warm. Hot)
Our research indicates successful flirting behavior between humans goes through 3
predictable and discernible Phases.
In each Phase, your behavior will change correlating with the increase of factors like
connection, attraction, investment, and sexuality as the interaction progresses. Most women
are highly tuned to and very aware (either consciously or unconsciously) that these phases
exist. Most men are not.
When you know what to look out for to recognize which Phase you're in, you’ll be able to
give her exactly what she needs from you to feel attracted, comfortable, and desiring to
escalate to the next Phase!
The 3 Phases of Flirting are all based off the same objectives, principles, and general flirting
concepts—but the specific rules, techniques, and flirting behaviors you will display in each
Phase are extremely different.
Phase 1 is Initiation: This starts from the first moment you see her. Make initial contact with
a woman to feel it out, start talking to each other, and assess your connection and attraction
to each other through conversation and flirting. Phase 1 flirting is playful, mysterious, and
fun, but not overtly sexual. This is the type of flirting you can practice with everyone.
Phase 2 is Escalation: After spending time with a woman in Phase 1, moving to Phase 2
will increase her desire for you even more. This is where you start to show more direct
interest, lay on heavier teasing and joking with her, and kick up the sexual talk and touching.
Phase 3 is Infatuation: This is where you build her desire and create lasting attraction as
you become more directly sexual with her. Once she moves to Phase 3 with you, you'll be
able to lead her to higher levels of intimacy, sex, and personal affection, and if you want to,
set yourself up for a meaningful future relationship
Ascend The Phases In Order
31
Each of these phases must be introduced to her in order, or you’ll end up a Perv, like the
guy in the above case study. Nothing will murder your game faster than busting out moves
she’s not ready for!
When you follow the Phases of Flirting while reading a girl's signals correctly, it creates a
magnetizing aura of awesomeness around you that girls just can't get enough of! But if you
haven't made sure it's okay with her before you progress to the next phase, don’t be
surprised if she completely closes off. Here's what I mean by this:
You may be having fun flirting with a woman in Phase 1 for quite some time, and you think
to yourself, “Gee, we've been in Phase 1 for a while, maybe it's time to move to Phase 2!”
But to execute The F Formula properly, you can’t just start using Phase 2 flirting methods
because you got bored of Phase 1 and decided it was time. You have to decode her signals
first and make sure she either verbally or nonverbally indicates she's ready to escalate with
you.
If her female cues tell you she’s not ready to go to the next Phase, stay in the current one.
However: If a woman is throwing Phase 2 or even Phase 3 signals your way, by all means
match her desires and bust out those higher phase techniques! If she’s ready for more,
there’s no reason you have to stay in, or even start with, Phase 1. There are several things
she might need in order to progress to the next Phase with you, but more on that in a
moment. First, here's how to…
Ramp Up Her Attraction
By Bouncing Around The I.E.I Phases
Although the Phases should be introduced to her in order, they should not always be used
one at a time. Bounce around to switch it up and keep it unpredictable, but never bounce to
a Phase you haven’t gotten to yet (until she indicates she’s okay with your escalation).
So if you’re in Phase 1, stay in Phase 1 until it’s okay to progress to Phase 2. But once
you’re in Phase 2, you can and SHOULD bounce back and forth from Phase 1 to 2
sporadically, using flirting techniques from both Phases. When you’re in Phase 3, bounce
around between all the Phases. This creates MORE attraction and desire for you. We'll
cover a lot more on this concept in the next chapter.
I’m going to tell you a little story to help explain why the 3 Phases are important and what
could go wrong if you don't know them. This is the story of a guy I went on a date with… and
he did everything wrong—or, to put it differently, he did everything in the wrong order.
32
Case Study: My Frightening Date Night
One summer night I was on a date with a guy I really liked. I’d been massively looking
forward to it. He was confident, down-to-earth, and funny—but unfortunately, it was down hill
from the moment we met—and it was all because he used the wrong flirting behaviors at the
wrong times. This is a cautionary tale—DON'T be him. Please.
First, he immediately started to use overt sexual innuendos. Like, right at the beginning.
When I told him I like dancing, he said with a wink, “You look like you’d be really flexible. I
like that.” Dude. I JUST met you!
Then he suggested we go outside together. Yeah right! Away from the safety of my friends?
With him, the creepy Perv who wants to…
“Get Flexible” With Me?
He got really touchy, putting his arm around me and squeezing my stomach. When I pulled
away and crossed my arms, I was politely indicating he should back off and I wasn’t
comfortable. So what did he do in response?
He shook my arms and said, “Why are you being uptight? You need to loosen up!”
No. What I needed was to get as far away from HIM as possible! This guy had NO idea how
to read my signals and respond appropriately! It turned me WAY off.
In F Formula terms, this dude was using techniques from Phases 2 and 3 when we were
BARELY scratching the surface of Phase 1. Plus, he was ignoring AND misreading my
cues. It’s a shame too—I really liked him in the beginning!
Aside from the “Loosen up” comment, everything he did would’ve been WELCOMED… IF
he’d done it at the right time.
That’s why it’s essential to know how to navigate the 3 Phases of flirting properly and
understand the female cues that tell you what she'll be comfortable with. Otherwise, you’ll
always lose the girl!
Once you know how to execute all three phases correctly, you’ll separate yourself from all
the creepy Pervs, like the one from the above case study, and you’ll always know what to do
to avoid ending up a Pal.
33
See why this is important now? Guys who learn the I.E.I. phases often start seeing exciting
new opportunities to attract women they had no idea existed before. It's truly something all
men should know, but most are severely unaware of.
Note: In the beginning all of this information will feel a little robotic but as you practice you’ll
start to notice how automated and fluid this process becomes. Trust me!
The 4 Goals
Now that you know how the 3 Phases of Flirting work, let's talk about what you're going to
DO in each Phase. Within each phase, there are four goals you’ll want to achieve in order to
move to the next Phase. I’ve labeled them as A. B. C. & D. to make it really easy!
Achieving and completing every goal at each phase is crucial and allows a woman to move
through each Phase with you naturally, balancing out Active and Passive Forces along the
way to ensure she's okay with your escalation. Once they're all accomplished, she'll be
ready to escalate with you to the next Phase of the F Formula. If she's not ready to escalate
to the next Phase... it means you still have one or more Goals to hit.
The entire F Formula is based off general, over-arching objectives, principles, and
concepts—but the specific rules, techniques, and flirting behaviors associated with them are
different depending on the Phase you're in.
That's why the 4 goals apply to all 3 Phases, but how you achieve the 4 goals will be
different depending on the Phase. For example, “A” consists of correctly displaying your
intent to the woman. How you do this in Phase 1 will look VERY different from how you
display your intent once you get to Phases 2 and 3.
Here are the 4 Goals you need to achieve in each Phase:
Goal 1: “A”- Correctly and clearly display your intent (Active Force)
Goal 2: “B”- Create and Instill Trust (Passive Force)
Goal 3: “C”- Build and Create desire for you within her (Active Force)
Goal 4: “D”- Decode her female cues to see if she’s positively responding
(Passive Force)
A => B => C=> D =’s Success
(and move onto the next phase)
34
In order to move on to the next Phase of the I.E.I Formula (a.k.a., ESCALATE flirting),
you need to verify in Goal D that she’s responding positively. If she’s not, it’s because
you haven’t met one or more of your previous 3 goals. Or, on certain occasions, it’s
just a mismatch and a sign it’s time to move onto the next woman.
Depending on which Phase you’re in, the ways you achieve these goals will be different.
We’ll detail the specific techniques and flirting behaviors for how you accomplish the Goals
in each Phase during the chapters dedicated to that Phase.
Got it? Good!
And That's The Structure Of The F Formula!
3 Phases, 4 Goals in each phase and advance forward. Now that’s not very complicated at
all, is it?
As you go through this material and try it out in the world, be sure to master each step at
your own pace. Slow and steady wins the race, and you’ll get a lot more out of taking your
time with this material.
You may want to take a few weeks or a month of going out and flirting to master Phase 1,
then take the next few weeks to a month to get the hang of Phase 2, and so on.
Your Ideal End Result
At the end of Phase 3 of The F Formula, if you followed it correctly, there are 6 things she’ll
be thinking and feeling that will allow her to be okay with escalating the interaction to get
personal and intimate with you ;). She’ll be thinking and feeling:
 This guy knows how to turn me on physically and mentally, which means he’ll
be good in the bedroom (you communicated this with Active Forces).
 He’s non-judgmental and accepting of what I do and don’t like; He doesn’t
think I’m a prude or a slut (you communicated this with Passive Forces).
35
 He’s not a Pal: He showed me he knows how to take action and be masculine
(you communicated this with Active Forces).
 He’s not a Perv: He can read my signals, and won’t make me feel used after we
get intimate—he has no ulterior motives (you communicated this with Passive
Forces).
 He’s interested in pleasing me and giving me a good experience; he doesn’t
see me as a sexual conquest (you communicated this with Active Forces).
 He’s attracted to me because I’m special and different from other girls (you
communicated this with Passive Forces).
By Phase 3 she should be thinking all six of these things, and if you go through the F
Formula correctly, she’ll be ready to surrender herself to an exciting adventure with you—
that’ll go wherever YOU want to take it ;).
Now that you know how all this works, let’s start at the very beginning of the interaction.
Most guys have no idea how to act early on, which rarely allows them to escalate any
further. So make sure you pay special attention to Phase 1 if you EVER want to consistently
attract the women you want!
PHASE 1: INITIATION (Cold):
Initiate Conversation To Gauge Connection And Attraction
Phase 1 is all about having fun, playing and not being overtly sexual. When
you know how to engage her in Phase 1, you’ll already be better at flirting than
98% of men out there.
So spending a disproportionate amount of time getting this part RIGHT will pay off
for you big time.
(If you need guidance on a great way to approach and start a conversation
with women so that you can “Initiate” Phase 1, go watch Marni’s video
explaining O.S.A in the bonus section)
PHASE 1, GOAL 1: CORRECTLY DISPLAY YOUR INTENT
When you begin your interaction with a woman, she needs to be aware of your intent as
soon as possible.
36
In Phase 1, keep her guessing about how much attraction you feel for her. She has to
feel like she doesn't know what you're going to do next. She has to feel like you might like
her... but she can't be absolutely sure.
And there's a beautiful way to do this in Phase 1. You communicate your intent...
Using Subtext!
Meaning, you show your intent as subtlety as possible.
As a general Phase 1 rule, the subtler, the better. Subtle communication from guys is like
chick crack! Look for OUR subtle communication in response—the nuances of our facial
features and eyes, small lilts in our voices, and the teeny tiny changes in the way we
position ourselves to you.
You can use subtle communication both verbally and nonverbally. Let's go over the
nonverbal first.
Using Subtext Nonverbally
Here's how to state your intent nonverbally in Phase 1:
1. Stand a little closer than you would with anyone else. But JUST a little.
• Turn your body only PARTLY into her, almost like you could walk away at any moment.
• If you do this right, she’ll feel at ease, and you may notice her actually beginning to vie
for your attention.
• If you’re not sure what this means, experiment with it—and you’ll find the Goldilocks
Zone when you see her attraction signals.
2. Your voice tone should be low and sultry, like you’re letting her in on a fun secret.
• At the same time, don’t be afraid to project or speak loudly from your diaphragm if the
situation calls for it. Girls find it a turn-on when a guy isn’t afraid of others around him
hearing what he’s saying. It shows us you’re confident and know what you’re talking
about.
• Your vocal intonation should be falling at the end of your sentences (NOT rising, like a
question. That’s unattractive to a woman).
3. Remember your proper eye contact and smirking!
37
• Don’t stare, but give longer periods of eye contact than you normally would.
• A good rule of thumb is 2 seconds, then look away.
• If she’s looking at you too and you can tell it’s “on,” just keep looking.
• Keep that hint of a sexy smile going!
4. Touch her AS SOON AS POSSIBLE in the interaction.
• This is the most extreme subtle sign you can give her—but it's arguably the most
important.
• Touch is a vital part of her experiencing you. If you don't do this, she won't get to
experience you fully, and a vital part of your flirting will be absent.
• If you don't touch her early on, it’ll be WAY harder for you to touch her after you've been
talking for a half hour.
• Review the section on touch in Chapter 1 and watch the video. Show her you can touch
her, you know where to touch her, and most importantly, you're not afraid to do so!
5. Have good posture.
• Let your shoulders fall back with your chin up. This shows you’re open to her. Don’t
cross your arms, fidget, or hold your drink out in front of you like you’re guarding
yourself. She’ll follow suit, and will open herself up to you in return.
• Keep your body free of overt tension. Think about how you carry yourself and move after
you’ve gotten a GREAT massage. That’s how you want to look.
Using Subtext Verbally
Whenever you show her the light, playful side of your personality that doesn't take the world
too seriously, you're correctly showing subtle verbal intent and creating attraction. Keep that
in mind as the overarching principle of this section, and know the techniques and examples
we give are merely ways of expressing that principle. NOTE: Any “lines” we provided are
strictly there to be used as guidance and training wheels. Use them as templates to spark
ideas that would work for you and your personality.
Remember, this stuff works best when you apply the rules and principles to YOUR
personality. The specific examples we give are to help you understand them better, and
maybe use as "training wheels” while you learn. Your ultimate goal is to attract the women
you desire while being authentically YOU.
Here are some ways to state your intent verbally in Phase 1, starting with the first thing you
say to her. You don’t have to use all of these suggestions. Find what works best for you!
1. Tease, challenge and banter!
38
Bantering is defined as: “The playful and friendly exchange of teasing remarks”. In many
ways, it’s a verbal back-and-forth; it’s more dance than duel, where the goal is for both
parties to enjoy themselves rather than one person or the other wounding or insulting the
other.
What bantering is not is being coarse, rude or insulting. One of the biggest issues I’ve seen
in dating circles are people who seem to mistake being an asshole for being funny. To
ensure your teasing/banter does not come across as harsh or Assholish make sure that
your body language and tone project that what you are saying is fun and playful.
Teasing, Challenging and Banter:
• Allows you to be playful and slightly sexual WITHOUT being overly direct. We wonder if
you really like us or if you're just having fun joking.
• Gives us women an easy opening to flirt back with you and escalate. All we have to do is
poke fun back at YOU… and the flirting is ON.
• MUST be coming from a place of self-amusement! If you look like you’re trying to
amuse HER, it’s a total attraction killer. Say things to entertain yourself. Not for her or
anyone else.
• Must be delivered in a playful, overly exaggerated voice tone… and a smirk!
• Examples: Make sure to check out the bonus section to watch a video example of
awesome flirting. PLUS I also have an article on banter that will further explain
how to banter correctly. It’s called The Fearless Banter Formula.
2. Call out that you’re hitting on her through a joke.
• This states your intent while relieving tension—it takes some of the pressure off, so you
can enjoy a natural conversation without weird nerves.
• Again—remember your smirk and joking voice intonation!
Here are examples of calling out that you’re hitting on her:
 I would totally hit on you right now, but the music’s so loud I don’t think you’d hear me.
What a shame! (In fact, you can follow ANYTHING up after “I would totally hit on you
right now, but…”)
 Look lady, I just don’t GIVE my number out to strange girls; it’s gonna cost you big
bucks.
 What kind of guy do you think I am to….
 Don’t think you can win me over that easily.
 Can you PLEASE stop hitting on me??? It’s becoming sad.
Obviously these examples are just for guidance. You have to choose what works best for
you. If these sound cheesy to you, don’t use them. But DO joke with her about hitting on
you in your own style.
39
3. Captivate her with your wit.
• Being witty means you’re making an observation about your surroundings that’s clever,
unexpected, and the opposite of mundane.
• Look around the room—there are literally hundreds of things you can talk about.
• Witty observations are out of the ordinary. Reframe a situation based on your unique
point of view (and we girls LOVE to see how your mind works).
Here are examples of witty observations:
 I think that guy skinned his couch to knit that sweater he’s wearing.
 That’s a big purse. Do you keep weapons in there? I don’t want any trouble.
(Check out my exercise for developing wit at the end of this chapter. I’ve also
included it in the bonus section.)
4. Self-amuse through playful self-love.
• When you PLAYFULLY use these lines so she knows you’re joking, it shows a healthy
sense of self-love. If you don’t communicate you’re joking—you come off like a
narcissistic asshole. So be SURE to show her you're joking with a smirk, eye contact,
and playful vocal intonation!
• These work EXTRA-well if you’re average or below average in the looks department.
Examples of playful self-love:
 God, I’m so smart.
 My reflection is so distracting, I’m sorry you had to be exposed to this level of sexiness.
 It’s really hard being this popular. You should give me like $20 out of pity because of
how hard this is.
 Can you please stop being so distracted by how handsome I am and concentrate on my
words?
5. “Smart”/Intuitive Observations Lines
• Making interesting observations about the world around you is always an interesting way
to connect and get close to a woman.
• A great way to do this is to talk about the people in the room. It shows you have social
awareness, and allows you to have fun by making up a back-story about their
relationship.
40
• I bet you those people over there are on their first date. Look at their body
language… (as you say this you can put her close to you so that you guys look
covert in your snooping)
• What do you think those people are talking about? They look so engaged, with
their feet pointing toward each other… something serious is afoot.
• That girl is acting like she's into him, but her feet are totally pointed the other
way. She's just being polite.
• Look at her clothes. What are the chances she's either in med school or law
school?
When you go out this week, try a variety of approaches to display your intent. Figure out
what works best for you! It might take a little bit of trial and error. But the most important
thing is that you DO it. You’ll be astounded at how girls respond to subtext.
Final Thoughts On Goal 1 in Phase A:
How To Be Confident
When you first approach her, you want to display confidence—but a lot of guys can get
confused about what that means. They can confuse it for cockiness…, which is a HUGE
turn-off! So know the difference.
Cockiness is arrogance. It means you think you’re better than everyone, including her.
When you brag, show off, appear try-hard… these are things that communicate cockiness.
Confidence simply means you’re proud of who you authentically are (no matter who that is)
and are comfortable showing that to her—which is a HUGE turn-on.
You don’t have to be an outgoing “life of the party” to be confident. If you’re an introvert,
own it. That's how you display confidence by being comfortable with whoever you are.
The truth is, girls will notice and be drawn to you whenever you’re authentic and genuinely
proud of yourself and the things in your life. No matter WHO or WHAT you are, wear it all
like a badge. That's REALLY what gets girls into you.
Plus a little bit of healthy curiosity about who this woman is, will help you evaluate and select
the women that are good for you. Showing that you to have a stake in the decision process
will also communicate confidence.
(Go watch the Women Tell All video in the bonus section to hear women reveal
examples of what happens when a guy displays intent correctly)
41
PHASE 1, GOAL B: EARN HER TRUST
If you completed Goal B in Phase 1 successfully, you subtly displayed your intent. Now
she’s enticed. Time to balance that intent and initial flirting with Passive Forces.
If you don’t earn a woman’s trust, she won’t feel comfortable escalating with you to Phase 2.
But at the same time, you don’t want to do so much trust-building that you end up a Pal.
So keep teasing and displaying your intent, but intertwine serious moments too—to give her
a chance to get to know you. How do you do this? You...
Make An Emotional Connection!
The following methods for emotional connection make YOU the obvious choice for her to
spend time with... so you can build her attraction for you even more.
1. Share who you are—but keep part of your life a mystery.
• Giving away TOO much information about yourself will make you a Pal. But sharing
some info about your life helps her relate to you and imagine herself with you.
• Share just one or two pieces of information from your life at a time, then move onto
something else, like a joke or a tease. Keep her wondering about you.
• Tell her something reminded you of a hobby you have, but only tell her you HAVE that
hobby. Don’t elaborate on it a lot after that. Change the subject.
• Sharing some of your thoughts and feelings is essential as well and should be done right
from the approach, but don't over share.
• Watch the tutorial video on this in the extras section called OSA--we go a lot
deeper on this concept there.
2. Use “We” statements.
• Using “We” statements puts you in a ‘bubble world,’ with just the two of you as
inhabitants.
• The more you frame situations where the two of you are doing something jointly, the
more you subtly communicate the feeling of “us as a couple” to her unconsciously.
• Any chance you get, refer to you and her as "we."
42
• If you met a girl at the bar and started building rapport, act as if you came there with her
from the beginning to hang out. Saying “We should go over here” is very different from
saying “Do you want to come over here with me?”
3. Touch her (according to Phase 1 rules).
• Touch is a VERY powerful tool. It can both amplify attraction and repel her, making you
a Perv—so be mindful of what you’re doing to get this right, and read her signals.
• Phase 1 touching should be used sparingly and playfully and NOT too directly sexual.
• Initiate Phase 1 touching as early as possible in the interaction.
• Touch her lightly on the shoulder when you’re introducing yourselves, or when you laugh
at something she says.
• Playfully nudge her when you say something witty, or even during a moment of silence
to break the tension.
• Put your hand on the small of her back for a second or two while you move around with
her.
4. Show your vulnerability without shame!
• Be honest about who you are without apologizing for it. This always comes across as
sexy confidence! It also shows you’re willing to take a risk for us in the face of your
vulnerability. Us girls LOVE it when you do this.
• Example: If you’re a naturally shy guy, admit it to her. When you approach her, playfully
say something like, “Hi, I don’t really hit on pretty women very often so forgive my
sweating or stuttering, but my name’s Shawn and I really wanted to come over and talk
to you.” "now I know why I am attracted to you". " I just can't help but notice ....."
• When you feel like you have to cover up or compensate for your shortcomings, we can
tell. And it’s NOT sexy.
• When you show your vulnerability, we start to see you as a three-dimensional human
instead of some dude who just came up and started talking to us. Plus, we find it
charming :).
• Don’t think of vulnerability as something weak. It’s actually you being real with her. I’m
not advising to start crying on her shoulder on the first date about being beaten up in 3rd
grade. I’m advising to not hide about yourself that you should and can be proud of. For
example: How you think about XYZ. Your divorce. Your kids. You don’t have to go into
full detail but own whatever is YOU instead of trying to cover it up.
(Check out Marni’s article in the bonus section for how to bring up sticky topics with
women and still come across as a confident man)
You'll Know You’ve Earned Her Trust When:
43
• She'll engage in playful banter with you trusting you won’t be one of those guys who
thinks she wants to go home with him just because she laughed at his joke.
• She’ll feel free to be around you without being skeptical you'll grope her boobs given an
unsolicited opportunity.
• She’ll let you touch her shoulder when you laugh, giving her validation.
• She’ll generally vibe with you in a friendly way.
When she’s engaging with you on this level and complying with your banter, you’ve hit this
goal and you’re ready to move on to Goal C! In fact--don't linger here too long. You'll end up
a Pal. So you should probably high tail it on to Goal C.
PHASE 1, GOAL C: CREATE DESIRE FOR YOU WITHIN HER
Now that you’ve accomplished Goals 1 and 2, you’ve sparked some initial attraction—she’s
interested, dude!
Now—this is where MOST guys drop the ball. In fact, this is the MOST IMPORTANT part of
Phase 1, and even the entire F Formula.
See, a fun, playful interaction with a girl is great, BUT—if you don’t ALSO spark sexual
tension… it will go nowhere except the friendship lane, and you’ll end up a Pal.
Once you get a glowing, positive response from a girl, it’s easy to want to make her laugh
and vibe with you even MORE. Most guys pour on techniques from Goals 1 and 2 over and
over hoping it’ll keep her on the hook and keep her interested.
But that’s actually NOT a reliable way to flirt. Here’s why:
You need to have HER investing in YOU… NOT the other way around.
This requires letting her attraction grow for you on its own—independent of what YOU do or
say. In other words, you don’t want to constantly be working for her attraction. So you have
to find ways to get HER to invest in YOU.
Now—the BEST time to do this during Phase 1 is when the conversation is at its peak, after
you've accomplished the first two Goals. She’ll be laughing, giggling, and thinking to herself,
“Wow, this guy is AWESOME… I really like talking to him!”
And that’s when you whip out The Boomerang Technique. Once you can do this
effectively, she’ll be falling all over you.
44
Here’s How You Boomerang (in 3 easy steps):
1. At a high point, take away the good feelings of talking to you and interacting with you.
When you do this, she feels the absence of your energy, your attention, and the fun qualities
about you she was just experiencing.
2. Preoccupy yourself with a friend, go to the bathroom, look around the room, or
anything else. Just don’t pay attention to her. That’s when she misses your presence, and
starts working to get your attention and win you back.
3. When you see her working to win you back, reward her investment: STOP doing the
takeaway and give her your attention and good emotions again.
This is why it’s called The BOOMERANG Technique: you come back to her as a reward for
her investment in you. Failing to reward her when she invests will discourage her from
investing further, and you don’t want that.
Let’s take a minute and talk about what it means when you boomerang away, then come
back and reward her for her investment. Because if you did it right, it DOESN’T mean you’re
a dick!
When you’re using the boomerang technique, you shouldn’t blatantly ignore her and TRY to
be a dick. There’s a subtle distinction between boomeranging away from interacting with
her—and blatantly disregarding her as an insult ...A.K.A., Being A Dick.
See, an attractive guy isn’t entirely invested in any new interaction with a woman—the rest
of his life has equal (or greater) value to any new connection he’s making with a girl and he
divides his attention accordingly.
When you’ve stopped paying attention to everything that was going on in your life just to
have a conversation with her, it will register in the girl’s head that you value your interaction
with her more than anything else you’ve got going on in your life.
And that doesn't say sexy things about your life. It says you don't have much going on. Why
would she want to be a part of that?
When you boomerang away, not only will she suddenly feel the absence of all your
awesome vibes (and want them back, which is good), it will also communicate to her that
you value your life outside of the conversation you’re having with her. As a result, she'll
think, "This guy's life must ROCK.” She'll want IN to your life.
Got it? Good.
45
Now—The Boomerang Technique can be applied in many forms, both verbally and
nonverbally. You should use it in all 3 Phases to create desire for you, and there will be
different ways to use it in each phase. Let’s take a moment to talk about a few different ways
to Boomerang in Phase 1.
Using The Boomerang Technique Nonverbally
1. Boomerang with touch.
• Pick your moments to withhold touch so you don't become predictable.
• Let’s say you’re bantering for a few minutes and the first time she makes a joke, you
touch her shoulder. The second time she makes a joke, you DON’T. Only bring back a
shoulder touch after you’ve waited out a few jokes without touching her, as a reward for
her investment in you.
2. Boomerang with your whole body.
• Act engaged one minute, with your chest and feet facing her. Lean in closely and make
lots of eye contact. THEN switch to angling your body away from her for a bit, focusing
on something else.
• If you execute correctly, when you come back to her, she’ll light up. Or she may even
hunt YOU down instead!
Using The Boomerang Technique Verbally
Don’t just share share share, ask ask ask—like you’re taking her medical history. Keeping
that mystery and intrigue lies in picking your moments to hold back with the information you
provide.
Share a little, be sincere for a minute, and then switch it up with a joke.
• Ask about her and listen intently, then change the subject away from her to an object in
the room or something going on in your life.
• Again, only boomerang back as a reward for her investments in you.
• Any time she goes out of her way to talk to you, ask you a question, etc., that's when
she's investing. So reward her by asking her about herself, her life, taking interest, etc.
• Then, take it away again by changing the conversation topic to a joke or tease.
Once you play around with different amounts of sharing about yourself, asking about her,
and bantering/joking, you’ll tap into the perfect Goldilocks Zone for conversation.
In conjunction with The Boomerang, there's one more short technique you should use to
create desire:
46
The Surprise Technique
The element of surprise is essential for you to keep it exciting—and keep HER excited. So
don’t just touch her shoulder over and over again. That’s predictable. Catch her off guard by
pushing the envelope every now and then, just a little ;)
To use the surprise technique nonverbally, find an excuse to see if she’s ticklish, or pull
her close to you for a moment around her waist. JUST for a moment though. That’s key.
The sudden escalation in touch will excite her. It tells her you’re game to keep your flirting
fun and progressively naughtier.
Push the envelope just enough to get her attention—but not enough to scare her off. Going
from an arm touch to a little grab around the waist is fun and exciting. Going from an arm
touch to squeezing her butt, however, is startling in a bad way—most girls will feel like
you’re groping them if you do this too early. You don’t want to be like the Perv who touched
my stomach too early in the Case Study above.
To use the surprise technique verbally, simply say something sexual for a brief second,
then return to completely nonsexual conversation. Here's an example:
Maybe you’ve been talking about something nonsexual, like bartending. Now grab her
attention by spicing it up. Lean into her and say something like, “I think you and I could mix
up some pretty good drinks of our OWN.”
Don’t be overly serious; say it with a hint of sultry playfulness in your voice while smirking...
and she’ll feel intrigued instead of threatened.
(Check out the Women Tell All interviews in the bonus section and watch women
reveal their POV on guys who push the envelope)
PHASE 1, GOAL D: DECODE HER CUES TO SEE IF SHE’S
POSITIVELY RESPONDING
You’re about to learn how to tell when a woman is comfortable escalating with you.
Pay Attention To How She Responds
47
Once you've boomeranged and used the surprise technique a couple times, make sure
she’s enjoying it so you know whether you should continue at this level or escalate physical
contact.
Here are some signs she’s into it:
• When you touch her, she touches you back.
• She leans into you.
• She talks more or gets more excited about what you’re saying.
Note: It’s ok if she gets a little shy, maybe even has her arms crossed in a “self hug.” As
long as she doesn’t look worried, maintains a lot of eye contact, smiles, and continues to
stand close to you, these are signs that you’re making her nervous in a GOOD way.
Here are some signs she’s NOT into it:
• She backs away from you.
• She frowns.
• She looks around the room more.
• She gets more serious, uses short answers, changes the subject, gives
tight, polite smiles, or doesn’t touch you back.
You’ll know you’ve got her hooked when you start seeing her eyes light up like a puppy dog
when she looks at you. Awwwww.
If a woman pulls back from your advances, it’s because of 1 of 2 reasons:
1. She’s not feeling it, OR
2. She needs more from you to be comfortable with that level of flirting.
This is where you decide whether you should exit gracefully, or simply hold back until she’s
ready to move forward. Move in closer to get into a more intimate conversation, and use
more directly sexual comments—essentially moving into Phase 2 (or, “trying Phase 2 out on
her”).
If you see cues she’s not ready to escalate, go back to Phase 1. Strike up some casual
banter for a while, until she’s open and responsive to you again.
Navigate your flirting to find out what she needs more of (i.e., which GOAL you haven’t
accomplished yet). She might need:
• More learning about you
• More trust built through emotional connection
• More masculine behaviors coming from you
• More playful banter
48
You’ll be able to tell what she needs when you see her energy change in response to what
you do.
What To Do If You Don’t See Positive Signals
The reasons for this are totally normal! Some girls have guys they’re already seeing, some
are closed off at the moment due to stressful life situations, some are only looking for guys
who have certain qualities (e.g., tattoos, hobbies, etc.), and some girls you approach may
even be lesbians.
In that case, say, “Hey it was good to talk to you. Have a fun night, stay out of trouble!”
You’ll keep your dignity and your air of confidence—and guess what?
It’s very common for a girl to become MORE interested after you make your exit, especially
when she sees you talking to other girls afterward. We start to think, “Maybe there was
something I didn’t see in him before… now I want to find out what it is!”
So it's not a big deal if this happens to you. There are PLENTY of girls right behind her who
will be totally receptive to you.
Female Body Language Cues
Here’s what her body language will look like when she’s almost ready to move to
Phase 2:
• She’s partially facing you, even if not directly.
• When you talk, she stands close.
• She makes a lot of eye contact.
• She has her arms open, maybe even a hand on her hip.
• She’s got good posture, she’s smiling, or fixing her hair.
In these cases, keep doing what you’re doing—and keep boomeranging.
Here’s what her body language will look like when she’s ready to move to Phase 2:
• She focuses more of her attention on you than before, especially if other people and
distractions in the environment are competing for her attention.
49
• She flirts with you more physically, like putting your arm around her, nudging you,
touching your hair, and generally finding an excuse to put her hands on you. (Notice I
said she needs to find an EXCUSE to touch you. If a woman is free with her touching—if
she does it a lot or doesn’t seem too nervous about it—it’s most likely a sign she doesn’t
feel sexual tension with you. She’s just touching you as a Pal.)
• She might fix herself up, smoothing her hair, or even stepping away to put on more lip-
gloss.
• She’s fidgeting: with her clothes, jewelry, anything like that. This is a sign she’s nervous
in a good way and feels the sexual tension with you—but ONLY if she’s giving you a lot
of eye contact and smiling at the same time. Looking around the room + fidgeting means
she's looking for an out to the conversation.
Remember those and actively look for them. They’re telling you she’s INTO you, man!
Female Verbal Cues
She’ll ask questions about you and is truly interested in the answers.
Women like to start painting a picture of who you are right away. We’re assessing what kind
of guy you are to see if you’re compatible with us.
Take her “interviewing” as a sign of attraction. Remember to still keep part of your life a
secret, but also give her open answers. Short, one-word answers don’t give you anywhere
to go in the conversation.
She’ll playfully tease or challenge you.
This is different from joking! So many guys have expressed their frustration to me about this,
saying, “We got along great, I made her laugh, she seemed to really love talking to me, I
don’t know why it didn’t go anywhere.”
The reason is because ATTRACTION is not the same as RAPPORT. Just because a girl
likes you does not mean she WANTS you sexually. How can you tell the difference? It’s in
the teasing and challenging. She’ll find opportunities to weave those into the banter, so it
goes beyond the pleasantries.
Now that we’ve covered the signs she’s interested, there’s one exception to these rules you
need to watch out for.
How To Know When She’s Flirting Just To Flirt
50
Sometimes girls will flirt with you just because it’s fun—without wanting to sexually advance
or give out her phone number. By all means flirt back and see where it goes—you just need
to be aware some girls may only be doing it for fun.
I totally get that you may not always be able to tell a woman’s true intentions. Doing
contradictory things can be an art form for us. But this should help you narrow down the
guesswork.
When she gives you a mixed message, it means 1 of only 3 possible things:
1. She’s flirting because it’s fun, without wanting it to go anywhere.
2. She’s afraid of being rejected by you so she’s not going out on a limb to show her
interest.
3. She’s legitimately going back and forth about how she feels about you, and her signals
reflect that.
Make your advances, testing out Phase 2 on her and see how she responds. If she doesn’t
want to go there, she’ll take the hint, stop flirting, and back off. Onto the next one!
Now--when it's tough to tell, there will be a few times when it boils down to a guessing
game. But that's not always the case.
Here are three DEFINITE signs you’ll only see if she’s interested:
1. She’ll talk about future plans and say things like “WE should…” or ask about your plans.
This indicates she wants to see you again.
2. She has strong reactions to what you think about her, or she’s fighting for your validation.
This is why teasing and challenging her is perfect, because she’ll want to defend herself to
you or playfully one-up you.
3. A “cry for help” so to speak—in other words, finding an excuse to ask you to do
something for her that she could have done herself.
Now—if she asks you to carry a heavy package upstairs for her, don’t be surprised if she
doesn’t give you her number. HOWEVER, if she leans over to you in a bar and says, “I
don’t know anything about whiskey, which one do you think I should go with?” She’s finding
an excuse to talk to you. Whenever a woman shows she NEEDS you in this way, it’s a great
sign.
To help you differentiate even further with this, take a look at the Women Tell All
interview video in the bonus section and watch women show you their signs for being
flirty, friendly or just polite.

Phase 1 Complete
Case Study: Phase 1 Done RIGHT
Here’s a quick story about one guy who perfectly executed Phase 1 flirting. He approached
me at a music festival. He was confident yet casual, giving me a perfectly executed vibe that
said: “I’m approaching you because I want to flirt. And I’m NOT a pal or a perv.”
The more we talked, I thought, “Wow. He’s the guru of the Goldilocks Zone.” He used
playful, witty banter and found the perfect ways to tease and challenge me. It made me feel I
was in good hands; he was never at a loss for what to say, or how to be witty, or to find
excuses to tease me. It made me want to tease him right back, and I found myself…
Craving To Know More About Him!
52
And he gave me little tastes of it, weaving in tidbits of info about himself and what he
thought about the concert. He asked questions about me too, without turning it into an
interview session. He even found small ways to touch me, when he complimented my
bracelets he lightly held my wrist. It sent pulses of tension through my body. It was sexy!
In just a few minutes he managed to create a spark between us, form an emotional bond,
and establish a rapport of sexy playfulness. As if it couldn’t get any better, he Boomeranged
from focusing on me, to paying attention to the music and his friends, and then back to me.
It made me crave his attention even more!
He wasn’t locked into our interaction, and wasn’t afraid of breaking rapport, which displayed
his confidence and showed me that he had other interests. Plus I got excited when he
circled back to talk to me… I was now challenged to vie for his attention, and that challenge
didn’t even exist just a few minutes ago! HE created it.
This is the kind of Phase 1 flirting that makes women want to zoom into Phase 2 as quickly
as possible. We think, “If this guy is this good, he’s DEFINITELY got more to offer me.”
Additionally, if you haven’t gotten her phone number, the end of Phase 1—after you’ve
decoded her cues that she’s into you—is a GREAT time. So ask away!
So remember that—and keep it in mind as your ideal end-goal. It’s WELL worth the practice
when you can evoke this type of response in any woman you choose!
Phase 1 Exercises:
If you’ve ever gotten a program from The Wing Girl Method before, you know that Marni
strongly believes in providing exercises and assignments to help you hone a skill. Practice
really does make perfect.
The exercises below are meant to help you hone the skills/tools required to successfully
tackle phase 1. These exercises are fun and can be integrated into your every day routine
with EVERYONE around you.
PHASE 1 WITTINESS: “Wit or Wit-Out You”
Here’s a quick story for you about a guy I thought was witty.
I was in Ikea checking out a walk in closet, and so was a guy standing near me. We both
saw there was a little girl playing in the closet. Without missing a beat the guy said, “Oh, this
one comes with a kid. That’s too much commitment for me.” I laughed and we bantered
53
back and forth a bit about, “Yeah, maybe I should just get a dresser instead” and so on. He
surprised me with his astute observation and it led to a fun and flirty exchange.
Here’s how you can develop YOUR wit: Over the next week, be hyper observant when
you’re out in public. Pick out 3 situations a day that are totally mundane, like getting coffee.
Notice a stranger near you who will be the mark for your witty comment. Take that mundane
scenario and observe what you imagine would spice it up and be pretty entertaining if it
actually happened.
For example, say you’re in line at Starbucks. Everyone is tired and bored and wants their
coffee. What I first imagine that entertains MY brain is the thought of the exact opposite
scenario taking place: to me, the opposite of a boring Starbucks line is a flash-mob. I find it
amusing to think of everyone in the line actually being there because they’re about to break
into a dance number. It’s the opposite of mundane. So I might turn to the guy behind me and
say, “I can sense the flash-mob is about to begin.” Take notice of people’s reactions to you.
And remember to have fun with it!
PHASE 1 CONVERSATIONAL THREADING: “The Tarzan Tactic”
Try this out with the next 5 women you talk to. When you’re starting out, it’s helpful to pick
girls you aren’t afraid to fail with, so you can be totally free to speak from your gut without
hesitation. So don’t try this with the hottest girl on your flag football team who you’ve been
itching to ask out since the start of the season!
When you’re talking with her, practice thinking of the next thing to say by instantly imagining
your conversation as a tree, and the topics as branches. Pick which branch you want to
swing to next and make a smooth, seamless jump. You’ll never run out of what to say
because you can always swing to a new branch.
Don’t hesitate or second-guess your choices. This will only put you in your head more. If you
were talking about Hawaii, and your first thought is that you learned how to juggle using
coconuts, go ahead and say that! It’s interesting, lets her learn a little about you, and hey—it
might make her laugh!
Don’t worry about impressing her or whether you’re boring her. Go with your gut, and if she’s
into it, then you know she likes you for the genuine YOU.
The Tarzan Tactic also works for approaching women and starting conversations. Like OSA,
you start by making observations about her or your surroundings. Pick one and go with it.
If you’re at a cool dive bar, your first thought could be about cool unique drinks. Figure out a
way to open with that. If your impulse is to try a new drink, walk right up to her and ask her
to pick out what drink you should order next. It immediately gets a connection generating
between you, and as you learned in the F Formula, you want to bypass all that meaningless
small talk that doesn’t allow for you to make a standout impression.

Phase 1 Summary
• Goal A: Correctly Display Your Intent
• Do it as soon as possible in the interaction.
• 2 Ways to do this are through Subtext (non verbal) and Subtext (verbal)
• Displaying confidence
• Goal B: Earn Her Trust To Make Her Comfortable With You
• Making an Emotional Connection: Share who you are so she has a better picture
of you (and can picture herself with you) but there’s still mystery.
• Use “We” Statements.
• Touch her according to Phase 1 rules—sparingly and playfully. Do this as
early as possible.
• Show Your Vulnerability—this is a STRENGTH, not a weakness. Never
apologize for it.
• Here’s how you know you’ve earned her trust:
55
• She engages in playful banter with you freely and openly.
• She’ll let you touch her shoulder when you laugh, giving her validation.
• Goal C: Create Desire For You Within Her
• This goal is focused on getting HER to invest in YOU.
• Once you get highly positive responses from her in Goals A and B, use The
Boomerang Technique:
• First, take away all the good feelings of talking to you/interacting with you,
so she feels the absence of your energy.
• Second, preoccupy yourself for a bit, until she invests in you in some way,
trying to get your attention back.
• Third, reward her investment: boomerang back from the takeaway to
encourage her to invest in you more.
• Using the Boomerang Technique Nonverbally:
• Pick your moments to withhold touch so you don’t become predictable.
• Boomerang with your whole body - act engaged one minute, with your
chest and feet facing her, then switch and angle your body away from her
for a bit.
• Using The Boomerang With What You Say:
• Keep the mystery and intrigue—pick your moments to hold back
information.
• Share a little and be sincere for a minute, then switch it up with a joke or
playful statement.
• Ask about her and listen intently, then change the subject away from her.
• Pay attention to how she responds—make sure she’s enjoying it.
• When she’s into it, she’ll touch you back, lean into you, and get excited
about what you’re saying.
• When she’s NOT into it, she’ll back away from you, frown, look around
the room more, change the subject, or give tight, polite smiles.
• The Surprise Technique:
• Use this to keep her excited and continue the unpredictability of the
interaction by catching her off guard with surprises.
• Push the envelope just enough to grab her attention
• Find an excuse to see if she’s ticklish or pull her close to you JUST for a
moment, around her waist.
56
• Say something sexual for a brief second, then return to nonsexual
conversation.
• Goal D: Decode Her Cues To Assess If She’s Positively Responding
• This will help you decide whether you should exit gracefully, or simply hold back
until she’s ready to move forward.
• When she’s almost ready to move to Phase 2, she’ll be partially facing you,
standing close to you, making a lot of eye contact, and smiling or fixing her hair a
lot.
• When she’s ready to move to Phase 2, she’ll focus her attention on you despite
other distractions, make physical flirting moves at you, she’ll fix herself up more,
and she’ll fidget with her clothes or jewelry.
• Her verbal cues she’s interested will consist of her asking questions about you
and being increasingly curious about you. She’ll also playfully tease and
challenge you a LOT more than before.
• The only exception to watch out for is when she’s flirting just to flirt.
• If she backs off after you make your advances, she’s recognizing that you
want to pursue her. If she doesn’t want to go there, she’ll stop flirting.
• DEFINITE signs you’ll only see if she’s attracted to you are:
• She talks about future plans.
• She has strong reactions to what you think of her, or is fighting for your
validation or approval.
• She’s finding an excuse to ask you to do something for her that she could
have done herself.
Once you’ve assessed that there is, in fact, a connection and attraction between you two—
you should now escalate to Phase 2!
Congrats! Time to ramp up the sexual communication with her! ; )
57
PHASE 2—ESCALATION (Warm)
After spending time with a woman, evaluate the progression and increase her desire for you.
In Phase 2, You’ll Be Escalating In 3 Areas:
1. Sexual subtext and sexual directness;
2. Banter, teasing, and challenging;
3. Physical contact.
Many of the techniques will be the same as Phase 1, only they’ll be more romantically and
sexually direct. Keeping all that straight in our heads, let’s start with…
PHASE 2, GOAL A: CORRECTLY DISPLAY YOUR INTENT
58
By now she knows you’re into her, but you’re not yet suggesting she go home with you. In
Phase 2, you're still feeling it out, and she’s not sold on you yet. You don’t want to pressure
her or she’ll get uncomfortable and back out.
What you want to communicate to her is, “I would love to take you home, but I’m not trying
to… yet.” Here’s how you do it.
Introduce Sexual Directness
In Phase 2, you’ll want to be much more sexually direct with her. Not COMPLETELY direct
yet though—just bring it a notch up. Not on full blast just yet.
There Are 3 Ways To Do This In Phase 2:
1. Admit or confess you find her sexy.
2. Tell her what you find sexy about her.
3. Talk about a sexual subject.
When you tell her you find her sexy—or what you find sexy about her—only do it ONCE.
After that, keep the focus on the topic of sex, and not her. For example: “I got this Kama
Sutra book as a joke gift, but I’m kinda dying to try out all the moves.” Or, “Would you ever
try tantric sex?”
Stay away from super direct questions like, “So do you sleep with guys on the first date?”
Most women find this off-putting.
Modify statements like this with subtlety and say, “I’ll bet you have a wild side.” It’s more
vague, playful, AND it doesn’t pigeonhole her as a slut. When you insinuate that she’s a slut,
it makes YOU seem like a Perv—it’s too aggressive.
In other words, don’t make sexual comments about her, but DO ask her what she thinks
about sexual topics. She’ll appreciate you doing this, and get even MORE turned on by your
restraint.
Another way to turn her on in this phase is by keeping your words non-sexual, but
communicating sexual subtext with HOW you say them. The technique for doing this
effectively is called “The Weatherman.” You can find an outline of it in the Extras section at
the end of this book.
59
Use B.T.C. To Escalate Sexual Topics
BTC stands for Banter, Teasing, and Challenging. This is much like the banter and joking
from Phase 1, only more direct. Here are some examples (again: remember these are only
examples, and you should take these principles and make them fit your personality):
• I think you have a naughty side hiding.
• You look good enough to eat.
• I feel like you’re going to corrupt me with that look.
• You’re one of those girls my mom warned me about, aren’t you?
BTC allows you to take risks with your sexual comments because they’re not serious; you’re
using them in the context of playfulness. Make sure and use them with the same joking
voice tone and smirking you used in Phase 1.
When you poke fun at her, make sure SHE’S laughing, too. To become a master of BTC
and get girls hooked on you, watch the interview clips below.
(I’ve included an exercise at the end of this chapter on PLATONIC SEXUAL SUBTEXT
called “The Weatherman”. It will help you develop this skill)
Escalating Your Touch
You should also make your touch more sexual in Phase 2. To do this, skirt her more intimate
areas with your hands, like her hips, side of her butt, chest and legs. SKIRTING, not directly
touching! That’s only appropriate for Phase 3 and beyond… cultivating patience and
delayed gratification will serve you well here ;).
Skirt, A.K.A lightly graze, any of these areas and pick your moments to linger a little. Just
don’t do it for too long—It’s creepy to trap her in a long hug, or spend minutes upon minutes
of stroking her knee. That’s too much; she’ll get uncomfortable and pull back.
To escalate the vibe in Phase 2, here’s a technique Marni has taught thousands of men, and
they all consistently get the same amazing results. It’s called…
60
“The Triangle” Technique
When you’re talking with a woman, slightly lean in, making eye contact, with a smirk on your
face. Then do a triangle with your eyes:
Look at her left eye, right eye, down to lips and back up to both eyes. Finally, smirk one
more time. This is a magic move that sends women into a tizzy excitement.
This move says, “I want you right now but I’m containing myself. I know you want me too.”
It’s a tiny tease that helps build sexual tension and anticipation.
Getting Alone Time With Her
It’s very important in Phase 2 that you get some one-on-one time with her, especially if you
met her in a public place like a party. Even if you’re already alone when you first meet, it’s
important to move her to a new location in Phase 2 at least once, preferably several times.
You can move to:
• Another part of the room
• Another room altogether
• Outside for some fresh air
• A different party/bar/venue
This is a great way to gage her interest in you. If she agrees, and especially if she seems
excited about it, it's an excellent sign she's attracted, curious, and enticed by you. If she
hesitates or agrees politely, it means she's still on the fence about you, but she's willing to
give it a shot--which means it's still on.
Keep teasing her, boomeranging between escalating touching and not touching her, and
increasingly sexual talk back to non-sexual talk.
Okay. You stated your intent, you’ve moved into Phase 2 touching, telling her you think
she’s sexy and what’s sexy about her. Now is the time to move to…
PHASE 2, GOAL B: EARN HER TRUST
In Phase 2 trust building, you want to reassure her she’s in good hands. Now that you’re
escalating to a more sexual and intimate level, she’ll back off unless you handle it tactfully.
61
If she senses you’re too timid, she won’t trust you to take control of the situation and guide
her along, which is a masculine quality women need. But if you’re too aggressive, she’ll feel
uncomfortable, like there's no reason why she would escalate with you in particular.
That’s why you need to balance out your verbal and touch escalation by also escalating your
emotional connection.
You do this by going deeper into sharing, learning about her, and finding common interests.
Weave your Emotional Connection in between the BTC playfulness to balance it out. You do
this by adding what I like to call…
But Seriously Though Moments
After you tease and banter for a bit, use the phrase, “But seriously though” to transition to
personal, connection-oriented topics. This allows the flirting to escalate on a deep, REAL
level and binds you to her emotionally.
It’s a great way of showing her you’re capable of more than just play; you also have depth.
If you want her to be comfortable with your physical advancements in the long run, you need
to do this. For example, when you’re teasing each other about who’s more of a movie buff,
switch it up with one of these:
“So what IS your favorite movie of all time?”
“My parents didn’t let me watch movies until I was 5!”
Other “But seriously though" moments might include subjects like:
If there were one thing that makes life worth living, what would it be?
I was such a geek in middle school, I had a rock collection and knew all their scientific
names.
Wait, you like that band? I LOVE that band! They were way better in the 90s though.
God, you're so sexy. I can't keep my hands off you!
A-ha! See how I switched it up on the last one with the element of surprise? You should do
that with her, too.
62
Deepen Your Connection Using “Callbacks”
A callback is when you recall the things you teased each other about previously and come
back to them in conversation. This indicates you have this “THING” between you.
For example, if she tells you early on she had a horrible haircut in high school—and you told
her with a wink that nothing’s changed—you can use that as a callback later (assuming you
got a good reaction from it).
To do this, be on the lookout for a conversational thread that lets you bring it up again. So
later, if she mentions an actress she loves, you might say, “Now THERE’S a girl with good
hair. You should take notes.”
As you’re flirting, stash a few in your mental back pocket to pull back out later. She’ll LOVE
it. It’ll strengthen the vibe between you, and she’ll be way more receptive to your physical
advances down the road as a result!
Keep balancing out your touch escalation, teasing, and bantering with Emotional Connection
and you’re well on your way to…
PHASE 2, GOAL C: CREATE DESIRE FOR YOU WITHIN HER
In Phase 2, continue to use the Boomerang and Surprise techniques to create desire for
you—but this time, incorporate a little more sexuality to get her riled up and wanting more!
Escalating Touch Using Boomerang & Surprise
To Boomerang with touch in Phase 2, use the same type of unpredictability you did in Phase
1—only this time skirt her more intimate areas then go back to neutral and chill out for a
while. Lean away and focus on something else until she invests in you. When that happens,
reward her investment again with your touching.
Don’t get too repetitive with this—if you do the same type of touching too much it won’t be a
reward for her anymore. So the first couple times, you skirt a more intimate area, then the
next time she invests in you, reward her with a slightly less intimate (but still validating and
rewarding) touch to remain unpredictable, even bouncing back to a “Phase 1 touch” on the
shoulder.
63
To surprise her, push the envelope a little into Phase 3. Touch her more, get closer to her
intimate areas, stroke more, and hold your touch for longer periods of time.
WARNING:
When you push the envelope, you MUST do it with confidence or you will be immediately
categorized as a Pal or Perv. If a woman senses your uncertainty, shame, or hesitancy,
she’ll think you don’t know what you’re doing—that’s a huge turn off. It may also seem like
you’re trying to “see how much you can get away with”… which is super creepy.
So NEVER hesitate! Touch with total confidence.
This doesn’t mean ignore cues that she’s not into it. Don’t be rapey—pull back if she doesn’t
positively respond—but don’t be tentative about INITIATING touch either.
Also, don’t react emotionally if she doesn’t receive it well. You did nothing wrong—she was
just letting you know it wasn’t okay yet. Hit Goals 1 and 2 more before you escalate touch
again.
Escalating Verbally Using Boomerang and Surprise
Boomerang between playful joking, BTC, and “But seriously though” moments. Remember
to bounce back to Phase 1 sometimes as well (like we talked about in Chapter 2). Sprinkle
in neutral topics like music or the bar.
You should also increase your use of “We” statements and “Let’s do this together”
suggestions. This includes what you’re doing in the moment as well as making future plans.
“Let’s go get some air.” “We make a good team.” …And so on.
Igniting Her Primal Brain
The reason the Boomerang and Surprise techniques are so effective at ramping up her
readiness to pounce on you is because they ignite a woman’s primal brain.
The primal brain is located at the core—it’s where we react at the most basic,
caveman/cavewoman level. It’s why we jump when we hear a loud noise. We direct our
attention immediately to unpredictable things that stimulate us by surprise.
64
The Surprise and Boomerang Techniques are specifically designed for you to spark a gut
reaction in her, getting her out of her critical headspace and keeping her primal brain
engaged.
Girls want you to get us out of our critical headspace—but we won’t do it ourselves. Often
times, we don’t know HOW to do it ourselves, and that’s why we’re so grateful to you when
you can swoop in and sweep us off our feet ;).
So remember that as you’re escalating in Phase 2. The more she's talking and interacting
logically with you, the less you’re engaging the primal brain. You want to take her on an
exciting adventure—it's what she reads about in romance novels and wishes would happen
to her in real life. You can be the guy who gives her that experience—and the Boomerang
and Surprise techniques are the keys to doing this!
(Make sure to check out an exercise I have for you at the end of this chapter called
Ignite The Primal Brain: Fire Starter. It will help you with this task)
PHASE 2, GOAL D: DECODE HER CUES TO ASSESS IF SHE IS
POSITIVELY RESPONDING
You’re doing well so far—and you’re getting closer to an unforgettable night together!
Here’s how to decode her cues in Phase 2 so you know whether you’ve hit the previous 3
Goals.
Signs Of Female Sexual Attraction
The signs she’s into you are a LOT more obvious at this Phase. These are the things a girl
will ONLY do if she’s sexually attracted to you—or at least interested in getting to know you
more so she can decide. She won’t do these if she’s flirting just to flirt—these are her green
lights. This is how you know it’s ON:
a. She lingers her physical contact with you.
b. She stares into your eyes.
c. She physically positions herself to be kissed or touched by you (Hint: if you
THINK she’s doing this, she’s doing it. Don’t self-sabotage here.)
d. She makes an effort or hints at getting you alone.
e. She makes any first moves—with touch, saying she thinks you’re attractive or
sexy, giving you her phone number, making future plans, asking about your
future plans, and making “We” statements.
65
To see if she’s ready to move on, you can do these same things to her and see if she
reciprocates. Look into her eyes for slightly longer periods of time than you have been, get
her alone, and touch her more.
She’ll take the hint—and she’ll let you know if she’s ready to escalate.
The Female POV: Attraction Cues
Let’s look at some clips on my girls’ own cues. Though some girls are more direct than
others, notice how many of them say they tend toward indirectness. Most women rely on this
to protect them from rejection or feeling vulnerable, and to keep the mystery of the attraction
going.
(Check out the Women Tell All Interview Video in the bonus section to see what
Attraction Cues look like)
Now you know you might have been completely skipping over women who were into you
because you didn’t see the signs! TAKE NOTE! You might be rejecting yourself from girls
who are TOTALLY into you!
Bouncing Between Phases 1 And 2
One last note to keep in mind throughout Phase 2: remember to periodically bounce back
using techniques from Phase 1 as part of your Boomeranging. It's especially effective when
you do this at a high point. For example, when you’re using Phase 2 touching, skirting her
intimate areas, and you can tell she’s enjoying it… hold back and bounce to Phase 1 where
you only touch her on the shoulder or back for a while.
Again, practice makes perfect with this—so the more you do it and the more feedback you
get, the more you’ll know how to use it to strike incredible sexual tension.
Bouncing around, along with the Boomerang technique, isn’t only helpful for maintaining and
escalating with her. If she’s LACKING desire for you, this can re-ignite her primal brain, and
with it, her interest and attraction.
66
Phase 2 Complete
Case Study: Phase 2 Flirting Done RIGHT
Here’s a quick story about a guy I’d been talking to, who took me on one of the most
amazing first dates I’ve ever been on—the highlight was his Phase 2 flirting skills.
He kept the sexual undertone alive throughout the date, with occasional lingering eye
contact, leaning into me, and finding moments to whisper in my ear or tease me. He also
peppered in compliments and “admitted” to me he found me very sexy.
I LOVED everything he was doing. I was excited, flattered, and intrigued by it. This gave me
the opportunity to admit my attraction to him as well. He led me to be alone with him at the
perfect time, switching locations from the restaurant to a walk on the beach.
When we left the restaurant, he put his hand on the small of my back and led me out the
door. It was just enough to get me thinking about what it would be like if…
67
He Touched Me MORE!
When we were walking around, he pulled out the Boomerang technique. He didn’t make any
physical contact with me for a while, and in fact bounced back to Phase 1 flirting, not trying
to escalate with me. I liked this because not only did it make me want more, but I felt
comfortable that he wasn’t slobbering all over me.
He was “playing it cool,” so to speak. Then he would surprise me with a sexy comment, or
grab me around the waist. Back and forth, back and forth, until I was coming to him, finding
ways to touch him and get him to flirt more with me. He gave me everything I was craving
from Phase 2, and electrified me with excitement about what would happen next!
Phase 2 Exercises:
The exercises below are meant to help you hone the skills/tools required to successfully
tackle phase 2. These exercises are fun and can be integrated into your every day routine
with EVERYONE around you.
PHASE 2 PLATONIC SEXUAL SUBTEXT: “The Weatherman”
Here’s a quick story about a guy I met who used platonic sexual subtext perfectly. I was
talking to him at a party about a mundane subject: the weather. It was raining and I
mentioned I liked the rain. This topic could have stayed totally surface level, but this guy
said, “I love to curl up in bed with a book when it’s raining.” He also gave me a little more
eye contact than usual, lingering on my reaction, and had a touch of a confident smirk.
On the surface, this comment is totally non-sexual and can be taken as such… but he made
it sexy in his delivery, the fact that he was sharing something about himself that also
happens to sound pretty sexy and fun. I felt like I learned something about him, and he also
showed me a hint of what was to come if I hung out with him more: Maybe I’D get to cuddle
up in bed WITH him while it’s raining! He laid the groundwork and let me make the
68
connections. Women get a lot of satisfaction out of making this kind of discovery. It’s a fun
alternative to having the man being the aggressor… sometimes you want to let them come
to you.
Over the next week, try this with at least 3 different women you build up a good rapport with.
Come up with similar statements, comments and questions as my guy did. They must be
neutral subjects, but charged with sexual undertones. When you think the time is right, “give
her the weather,” so to speak:
Give her a lead in, then after she responds, follow it up with a statement that has subtext
SHE can jump to conclusions about. Here’s another example:
Let’s say you’re in the grocery store and you’re talking with a girl about how you like to cook.
First off, don’t say, “I’ve got a big zucchini in my basket if you wanna see it”! Instead, take
the subject of cooking and drop in a subtext you can use where underneath you are
communicating: “I want to see you again and do things with you like cooking, which could
lead to getting it on, on the kitchen counter.” But obviously—don’t say it like that.
What you would actually say is, “I love cooking with another person. It’s so satisfying to
make a home cooked meal.” Or: “I’ll bet you’re a good cooking partner because you seem to
know what you’re doing”. You could even go 1 level further if you guys are really hitting it off
and say something like “Let me see your hands (she shows you her hands). You have good
hands for cooking. Soft yet I can tell you know how to get rough.” Remember to make eye
contact and give her a little smirk or smile that lets her know you might have more on your
mind than cooking. Using sexually charged words like satisfying, big, and warm doesn’t hurt
either! I want you to really practice picking the right moment to slip these statements in.
And yes, I said slip them in ;)
PHASE 2 IGNITING OF THE PRIMAL BRAIN: “Fire Starter”
Come up with 5 things you wouldn’t typically start a conversation with. Approach 5 women
with these over the next week and take note of their responses. Remember to use what you
know about OSA, employing your wit, and your sense of playfulness to come up with
openers that feel like they belong more in the middle of a conversation.
Try to bypass all the polite introductions and jump right in with a bold observation, statement
or question that gets her immediately paying attention to you. It shouldn’t be anything too
shocking, just something that you might say after talking to her for a while. For example,
“Cheesecake is my absolute favorite dessert.” You can go with something totally out of the
blue like that, or something more relevant to her or your situation, like, “If I had to walk in
your heels, I’d definitely fall. Those things are high as hell!”
If you’re feeling extra brave and you’re in the right setting, like a club where women are
expecting you to hit on them, try something like this: “Nice boots!” When she says thanks,
69
follow it up with, “No, I said nice BOOBS!” With a statement like this, the key is to smile and
make sure she knows you’re joking.

Recall the things you teased each other about earlier
• Goal C: Create Desire For You Within Her
• Escalate touch using Boomerang and Surprise Techniques
• Skirt her more intimate areas then go back to neutral and chill out for a
while.
• When she invests in you, reward her investment with more touching.
• To surprise her, push the envelope a little into Phase 3.
• Escalate verbally using Boomerang and Surprise Techniques
• Boomerang using playful joking, BTC, and “But Seriously Though
Moments.”
• Increase your use of “we” statements about what you’re doing in the
moment and future plans.
• Igniting her primal brain: Any time the conversation gets more logical you can
use the Boomerang or Surprise techniques to ignite her primal brain.
71
• Goal D: Decode Her Cues To Assess If She’s Positively Responding
• If she’s interested in escalating further, you’ll see the following signs:
• Lingering physical contact.
• Staring into your eyes.
• Physically positioning herself to be kissed or touched by you.
• Getting you alone.
• Making any first moves—touch, saying she thinks you’re attractive or
sexy, giving you her phone number, making future plans, asking about
your future plans, and making “We” statements.
• Bouncing Between Phases 1 and 2:
• Throughout Phase 2, bounce back to Phase 1 while you’re at high points
in the interaction.
• Bounce from sexual to neutral topics. Directly display your attraction, then
back off and keep her guessing.
• If she’s lacking desire for you at this point, this can reignite it.
Score! She’s turned on and DEFINITELY wanting you more and more with every passing
minute. Good job, dude! Get excited, but stay cool. Now it’s time to waltz on over to…
PHASE 3—INFATUATION (HOT)
Build her desire and create lasting attraction as you become more directly sexual.
In Phase 3, it’s clear you want her and can tell she wants you. You’re
maintaining and escalating the heat between you. You’re more directly
sexual, verbally and nonverbally. Less small talk, more action!
You’re building lasting attraction. You’re solidifying yourself in her mind as
a desirable man who knows what he wants—and knows how to give her
what she wants, physically, mentally and emotionally. Can you feel the
magnetic pull between you?
Here’s where you ENSURE she sees you as more than just “some guy”,
which allows her to become intoxicated.
72
PHASE 3, GOAL A: CORRECTLY DISPLAY YOUR INTENT
In Phase 3, you’re still Boomeranging, but when you’re focused on her, it’s strong, direct,
and without hesitation. When you Boomerang OFF of her, bounce back to Phases 1 and 2 a
lot.
Sexual Directness
Here are some ways you can build on the sexual directness from Phase 2:
• Tell her exactly what you find sexy about her.
• Tell her what you want to do to her—though you may still want to convey it indirectly.
Gage what you tell her based on how she’s responding to your previous sexual
comments.
• Tell her how she’s driving you crazy.
• Your BTC is focused more on expressing what you want to do to her.
You’re now very close to each other while talking, your voice is low and sultry, you’re doing
more and more touching all around her sexiest areas, for longer periods of time, grazing,
lightly squeezing, then pulling back to make her want it more.
Kissing is a plus too. If it hasn’t happened yet, touch her hair, move in for one, and make it
happen. It’s a good idea to do that at the end of Phase 2 or the beginning of Phase 3.
Getting Her Alone With You
If you aren’t already alone with her, the time is now. TELL her you want to be alone.
Suggest you go somewhere, whether it’s just outside or to your place.
Now—the purpose of getting her alone isn’t just to escalate physically. You need to get her
on “Your Turf and Terms”, or your “TNT”.
What that means is YOU make the decision when and where to go. You’re displaying your
confidence by doing this, which is intoxicating to women. She WANTS you to lead her, to
take her into your fantasyland of unfamiliar territory where it’s exciting, different and sexy.
It’s a way for her to experience you even more—and continue the roller coaster ride.
Side Note: If she says, “Let’s go outside,” great! She’s showing you she wants you. But
simply complying with her doesn't mean it's YOUR TNT because she's deciding. To amplify
73
her attraction even more, tell her, “Sure. Hey, come over this way with me,” and make it an
outside area of YOUR choosing. Always look for opportunities to lead her.
Keep bouncing and boomeranging after you’ve changed locations. Once you’ve moved her
to your TNT, Goal A is DONE.
PHASE 3, GOAL B: EARN HER TRUST
Maintaining her trust and comfort in Phase 3 is important. You want to keep her on that
exciting ride with you. If she senses you’re unsure of what to do, she’ll second-guess that
she’s in good hands. Remember—she wants to feel your absolute certainty.
Ease Her Reservations
You may already know this from experience--but us girls have a lot of hesitations, worries,
and reasons we feel we shouldn’t sexually escalate with you. If you can understand and
remove them, we’ll feel free to do all the crazy things we TRULY want to do with you
underneath those reservations.
Now—I’m not saying you’re always going to get her to sleep with you the same night. You
might. But if you don’t, you can at least get the desire instilled in her for a later date. You
want to position yourself in her mind as the perfect candidate.
Men and women have completely different thought processes when Phase 3 comes
around.
While men think in the now, women think in the future.
Men think: “She’s turning me on. I want to sleep with her.” Women think: “He’s turning me
on. What will happen if I sleep with him?” In other words, she’s afraid of being taken
advantage of and regretting it after you have a great time with her.
For that reason, you need to keep the experience of flirting going to show her that won’t
happen. Too many guys get this far, see that she’s into them, and immediately try to make
out/pseudo-rape her. This conveys to the girl that you’re horny and needy, and that you
haven’t been with a girl before, which will turn her off like a light switch.
After You Get Her Back To Your Place
(Or On Your TNT)
74
The NUMBER ONE rule right after you get alone with her is to avoid jumping on her
immediately! (Unless you're certain she wants to pounce on you right then and there. But if
you can't tell, don't take any chances!)
She needs to feel calm, relaxed, and safe. Take this part slow. Offer her a drink. Tell her to
take a seat for a second while you wash your hands, and leave her alone. Show some
restraint.
Keep moving two steps forward, one step back. Earning her trust and easing her
reservations involves knowing everything she needs to think and feel—the 6 points we
outlined in Chapter 2. Let’s review them.
She needs to think and feel:
• This guy knows how to turn me on physically and mentally, which means he’ll be good
in the bedroom (you communicated this with Active Forces).
• He’s non-judgmental and accepting of what I do and don’t like; He doesn’t think I’m a
prude or a slut (you communicated this with Passive Forces).
• He’s not a Pal: He showed me he knows how to take action and be masculine (you
communicated this with Active Forces).
• He’s not a Perv: He can read my signals, and won’t make me feel used after we get
intimate—he has no ulterior motives (you communicated this with Passive Forces).
• He’s interested in pleasing me and giving me a good experience; he doesn’t see me as
a sexual conquest (you communicated this with Active Forces).
• He’s attracted to me because I’m special and different from other girls (you
communicated this with Passive Forces).
If you’ve completed Phases 1 and 2 correctly, the woman you’re flirting with will be heading
toward ALL of these, and she’ll have zero reservations by the end of Phase 3. If she DOES
have reservations, it’s because she DOESN’T think or feel one or more of the above.
If she came with you on your TNT, it’s likely the Active Forces you just exhibited by bringing
her there need to be balanced out by showing her:
• Your restraint
• You don’t view her as a slut
• This isn't a big deal to you
75
So use the connection tools described in Phases 1 and 2 to Bounce away from intimate
touching for a second and have a little bit of meaningful conversation.
To help you further destroy her reservations, keep in mind this quote from “The Art of
Seduction” by Robert Greene:
“Stimulate a curiosity stronger than the doubts and anxieties that go with it, and they will
follow you.”
How do you stimulate curiosity? Keep using the Boomerang and Surprise Techniques. Keep
her feeling like she doesn’t know what’s going to happen next.
PHASE 3, GOAL C: CREATE DESIRE FOR YOU WITHIN HER
By now, you’ve escalated quite a bit and balanced out any reservations she has with the
necessary Active and Passive Forces. You've kissed her, you've touched her in intimate
places, and she's enjoyed it.
The key now is to not let it cool off—so she remains swept up in the irresistible cyclone of
“You Plus Me Equals WOW.”
1. Be confident with everything you do
• Have no hesitation or reservations with your physical advances and the sexy things you
whisper to her.
• If she rejects your advances, it was still the right thing for you to do. Just back off for a
while and balance those advances with Passive Forces like connection, then try again in
a little.
2. Pull back if you sense she’s closing off.
• This reassures her you know what you’re doing and you’re acknowledging her
boundaries. Both are huge turn ons for us, and will counter intuitively speed up the
process a LOT.
• It's okay to Bounce back to Phase 2 or 1 for a bit if you need to.
3. Make BOLD moves!
• Women love bold moves—especially in Phase 3. They’ll respond with excitement and
intrigue—you’ll end dates leaving a lasting impression. She won’t be able to get you out
of her head!
76
• Don’t play it safe—that won’t get you ANYWHERE. Make strong choices in one
direction. She may not respond, but if she does, the response will be more powerful than
ever.
• By far the biggest and most prevalent mistake guys make in every Phase—but
especially Phase 3—is being AFRAID to make bold moves. Guys are too cautious, nice,
pleasant, fun… and they never take risks like approaching or bringing up sexual topics.
What they don't realize is us girls are DYING to see this from you.
• Showing the ability to take risks is a POWERFUL aphrodisiac for us! PLEASE do it
more!! You won’t end up a Perv, especially if you're already in Phase 3!
Don’t reject yourself before a woman has a chance to. Take those risks. If she doesn’t like it,
she’ll let you know. Just watch the clips below to learn more about how highly effective this
is.
(Check out the Women Tell All Video in the bonus section to hear the women talk
about a guy’s confident moves)
Check All Her Boxes
By now you’ve communicated you’re not a Pal or a Perv, and you displayed that you know
how to physically, mentally, and emotionally turn her on. If you review the 6 points from
above, there are two more ideas you need to communicate once you’re in Phase 3:
1. You’re there to have non-judgmental fun with her.
2. You’re drawn to her because she’s unique.
Relieving her anxieties about these subjects allows her to open up and let her desires flow
more freely. Callback the subjects you connected with her on earlier to show her why you
like her, and tell her you find her sexy because of it.
To illustrate this point, here’s a personal story from Marni:
“I was with this guy that I barely knew but was wildly attracted to. Up until this point, you
could call me a huge prude. When I got back to his room after flirting for a bit, we started
making out. Then he reached around to take off my bra and I immediately tensed up and
pulled back.
That’s when he did the most amazing thing a man has ever done. He stopped. Looked at
me and said, ‘If I’m doing anything that makes you uncomfortable, just slap my hand and
we’ll stop.’ That immediately made me feel more comfortable and relaxed—I didn’t have to
slap his hand.
77
With that one simple sentence he was able to free my mind of all insecure, doubtful thoughts
and let me choose my own sexual course. Had he ignored my tension, I would have ended
things and found an excuse to go home. But he showed that he could tell something was
wrong and reassured me that I had a choice in whether or not we continued.
PLUS it showed me that he wasn’t desperate for sex. He could take it or leave it. All
reassuring things that helped me feel safe and relaxed.”
Switch Up The Power Roles
Another fun technique that helps you “check all her boxes" is to temporarily switch up the
power roles. Show her you’ve become powerless to her overwhelming sexiness and feel like
your urges to touch her and say sexy things are uncontrollable… and it’s HER fault.
You’re telling her, “Look what you do to me… It’s so hard to control myself around you!”
This accomplishes a few things:
 It lets you have more freedom in how sexually playful you become with
her. After all—you can’t control it!
 It’s a huge compliment to her. We love compliments :)
 It’s another way to surprise her with your behavior, after taking charge of
much of the interaction. It’s a fun twist that you’ve fallen under HER spell.
She’ll have fun taking the lead with you.
Now the REAL fun begins. Get ready to hit…
PHASE 3, GOAL D: DECODE HER CUES TO SEE IF SHE’S
POSITIVELY RESPONDING
You’re not quite at the finish line yet. If her reservations come out last minute, or if she’s not
feeling it at the very end, there are some signs you need to watch out for.
The Hidden Ways She’ll Steer The Interaction
78
It’s important to be aware of the subtle ways she communicates before you “go in for the
close."
If she’s not interested, or has become disinterested, she’ll try to steer the interaction back
into the nonsexual realm. Here's how you know this is happening:
• If you say something flirtatious or sexual—she’ll purposefully turn it nonsexual
• She'll say this while breaking eye contact
• She'll shift her body position when you suggest intimacy
• She’ll look for an excuse to get out of the conversation
Guys sometimes take this as a sign the girl didn’t GET that he was trying to make a sexual
move. So they try to drive it home even harder and get more direct.
Don’t do this—she KNOWS what you meant. ALWAYS.
When she responds in this way, she’s countering your moves to distill your advances. She’s
telling you politely, “I don’t want what you’re putting out there. Sorry bro.”
This is more subtle than a man would normally act. But if you can get used to recognizing it,
you’ll get a LOT better at figuring out what she needs at this stage to be into you. Here’s an
example:
Let’s say you ask if she likes wine, and she’s feeling your advances. She might respond, “I
LOVE wine, it makes me feel so relaxed.”
If she’s NOT into it, she won’t help you go down that path. She’ll steer the conversation
away by saying, “I like wine. If you’re looking for a good cabernet, I could give you some
recommendations.”
Notice she might refrain from using words like “love” and “feel.” She’ll also refrain from
making intense eye contact or smiling a lot.
This is when you want to take a step back and bounce to Phase 1 or 2… or get out of it
completely if you see fit.
Bouncing Between All The Phases
In Phase 3, any time you boomerang, bounce between ALL the Phases a LOT. This is how
you build desire and recalibrate when you need to. If she pulls away from your Phase 3
advances, go back to Phase 2 or 1 until you assess she’s open to you again. Wash, rinse,
and repeat.
79
Phase 3 Complete
Case Study: The Guy Who Nailed It In Phase 3
One guy I went out with a while ago totally nailed Phase 3 flirting. It was unforgettable!
We’d already had a great time in Phases 1 and 2. He picked up on all the cues I sent out
that I was ready for 3. When we were out, I was very responsive to all of his advances, both
physical and verbal. I would touch him, look into his eyes, move my body close to his, and
was game to incorporate sexuality into our talking, joking and touching.
He held back just the right amount, not pushing me to sexually escalate, just enjoying the
heat that was building between us—which, of course…
80
…Made Me Desire Him Even MORE!
When he WOULD touch me or say something sexy, he did it deliberately and confidently.
When he kissed me, he didn’t hesitate for a second. Now—if he’d looked worried that I
would pull away, it would’ve ruined the passionate moment.
And of course, he picked his moments to pull back, switch up the sexual heat with playful
fun—and kept me on my toes.
This Phase 3 master was responsive to my cues, advanced with confidence, kept my desire
building with surprises, twists and turns in what he said and did, and through all of it showed
me he was a genuine, fun, dynamic guy with a LOT to offer me.
I guess you could say he “had me” at Phase 3 ;)
If you’ve succeeded in all these things, she’ll be COMPLETELY enamored, turned on, and
ready for ACTION. She’ll be thinking, “Finally! A guy who has all the essential qualities
to make this night incredible:
…He knows how to turn me on physically and mentally, which means he’ll be good in the
bedroom.
…He’s interested in pleasing me and doesn’t see me as a sexual conquest.
…He’s not a pal: He’s going to appreciate me but not act submissive.
…He’s not a perv: He won’t make me feel used.
…He’s non-judgmental of me: He doesn’t think I’m a prude or a slut.
…He’s attracted to me because I’m special and different!”
Get ready for a WILD night. And when you’ve gotten past all her reservations, she’ll reward
you in ways most guys only dream about. If you’ve mastered the F Formula, you deserve it!
;D
Phase 3 Exercises:
The exercises below are meant to help you hone the skills/tools required to successfully
tackle phase 1. These exercises are fun and can be integrated into your every day routine
with EVERYONE around you.
PHASE 3 CREATING DESIRE: “Lightning Bolts”
81
You already learned about creating sexual tension, then giving her relief: By withholding
attention and touch sporadically, and then giving it to her after she craves it intensely. This
exercise is for you to practice when to hold off on giving her the “release” in Phase 3—when
she’s craving and responding to your touch and affection more than ever.
Knowing how to send her Lighting Bolts is the key to red-hot interaction. When you’ve
reached Phase 3 flirting, you might get the desire to be all over her—you’ll feel like it’s going
really well and you might be afraid she’ll lose interest if you pull away.
WHEN you feel this need to pull towards her, take it as an indication to pull AWAY instead. If
you feel your own restraint being tested, know that’s exactly what you’re doing to her. So
next time you reach this level with a woman—and I want you to get there this week—try this
restraint, and then take note of how much MORE powerful it is when you actually DO touch
her knee, or tell her she’s got a fire in her eyes, or whatever works for you.
What you want to do is pick out some moments when YOU are feeling the strongest urge to
touch her, kiss her, tease her, or say something sexy to her. Instead of going for it, you
resist your urge. She’ll feel this resistance too—and get nervously excited around you all
over again, wondering when you’re going to make another move, or WHY you didn’t at that
moment. It makes her feel like she still has to chase you. Then when you do make your next
move, she will feel it like a HOT bolt of lightning!
Imagine just touching her and shooting electrical impulses of pleasure ALL over her body.
That’s what this exercise does to her.
Phase 3 Summary:
• The goal of this Phase is to maintain and escalate the heat between you. Get more
directly sexual.

Chapter 3: Review of What You’ve Learned
84
• The F Formula Phases:
1. Initiation - Make initial contact and assess your attraction to one another.
2. Escalation - Spend time with her, evaluate the progression, and raise her desire
for you.
3. Infatuation - Become more directly sexual, build her desire, and create lasting
attraction.
• You MUST ascend the phases in order. Doing so out of order will make you come
across as a creepy Perv.
• You’ll ramp up her attraction by bouncing back to previous I.E.I Phases and keeping it
unpredictable.
• In each Phase, you'll have Four Goals to reach:
Goal A: Correctly display your intent
Goal B: Earn her trust
Goal C: Create desire for you within her
Goal D: Decode her female cues to assess that she’s positively responding.
• In order to move to each next Phase, ALL of these goals need to have been completed.
If you try to move to the next Phase and she backs off, one or more of these goals
hasn’t been completed.
• What you do to achieve each goal will look different depending on the Phase you’re in.
• At the end of Phase 3, you will have balanced out Active and Passive Forces so she
thinks and feels everything she needs to so she’s ready to comply with your requests to
have an unforgettable time together.

Final Message From Marni
It’s Marni again.
We certainly touched on this throughout the program, but this is one of the most important
parts—I wanted to remind you again to be SURE we’re clear:
While flirting is one of the most essential skills to have when it comes to interacting with
women, flirting alone will NOT get you the girl. Flirting sparks attraction/chemistry but in
order to really get a girl and keep her hooked, hanging on your every word… to get her to
want to answer the phone when you text or call… to get her to squirming in anticipation to
see you again and again… to get her thinking of you and wondering what you’re up to when
she doesn’t hear from you… you HAVE to couple your flirting with connection.
Female Attraction Is Created By Her EMOTIONS.
87
…And emotions are really just temporary chemicals that course through her veins—without
connection, she won’t associate that feeling of attraction with YOU.
Instead, her brain will associate it with just “having a fun night” because she won’t TRUST
you. This is how you get girls who flake on you when you try to move things to the next
level! I’m SURE you’ve encountered this before—almost every guy has.
IF you DO want to take things to the next level (which, if you’re still reading this, I’m pretty
sure you do), I invite you to check out my other program called How To Become A Man
