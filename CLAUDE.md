# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

VoiceAgent is a new project in early development stages. The repository structure and architecture will be defined as the project grows.

## Project Name Note

The project directory is named "VocieAgent" (note the spelling), while the README refers to "VocieAgent". Be aware of this naming when referencing the project.

## Current State

This is a newly initialized repository with minimal structure. As code is added, this file should be updated with:
- Build and test commands once a build system is established
- Architecture overview once core components are implemented
- Development workflow once dependencies and tooling are configured
