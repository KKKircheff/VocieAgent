export const contextData = `The F Formula is presented as a Wing Girl-Guided Blueprint designed to combine the fundamentals of female psychology with a man's genuine personality to achieve effortless flirting, attraction, and escalation with women. The program promises a step-by-step process that will take a woman from being a stranger to being fond of a man's presence and adoring every minute she spends with him. Flirting is defined not merely as a sexual activity, but as adult play—a stimulating combination of teasing, challenging, sexuality, and fun. Mastering flirting is essential because it is the key to communicating attraction to women on a fundamental, gut level. It is important to recognize the difference in definition: men typically view flirting in a sexual nature, while women initially picture fun, playful, and exciting banter that rarely includes anything sexual at first.
Balancing Forces: Pal vs. Perv
Effective flirting requires balancing opposing forces to avoid the two major pitfalls that men encounter:
1. The Pal: This guy is characterized by being too passive, avoiding risks, and overanalyzing the situation. Because he fails to initiate anything sexual or convey interest, he holds back on stating his intentions and ends up directly in the friendship lane.
2. The Perv: This guy is too active and uncalibrated. He comes on WAY too strong, gets aggressive, and doesn't read the woman's signals, often resulting in him being labeled as creepy.
To navigate these extremes, a man must constantly balance Active Forces (which drive action) and Passive Forces (which ensure calibration and trust). Active Forces include displaying confidence, showing intent, focused initiative to move the interaction forward, and initiating touch, kissing, or sex. Passive Forces involve objective judgment of the social environment, authentically listening, accepting the environment, and knowing how to earn trust. The goal is to remain in the Goldilocks Zone, which represents the "just-right" balance between these forces, maximizing female attraction.
The 6 Essential Flirting Tools
These tools serve as the foundational skills necessary for proper flirting:
1. Proper Eye Contact: This must be subtle and direct. A man should give 5–7 seconds of soft but direct eye contact before slowly breaking away and returning. It is crucial to look a woman in the eye without flinching, as avoiding contact is an "immediate NO".
2. Cultivating A Good Smile (Smirk): An "over-smile" can signal neediness or approval-seeking. The recommended flirting smile is a half-smile (smirk), which communicates mystery and confidence. The smirk should be used in conjunction with teasing and playing.
3. Touch: Touch is vital but must be executed carefully. Initial Phase 1 touching should be sparingly and sporadically on non-intimate areas like the shoulder or upper back, lingering for no more than a second or two. Initiating touch early is key, as delaying it makes subsequent touch seem weird.
4. Proper Body Language/Being Masculine: Nonverbal communication is essential, accounting for about 85% of communication women notice. A man must project relaxed confidence and avoid nervous, stilted body language. Active masculinity creates attraction by assuming the responsibility to initiate and move the interaction forward.
5. Be Open With Your Intentions: Men who are successful flirts have no concern about making their attraction known. Hiding intentions is viewed as rude and results in a "direct pass to friendship land".
6. Flirt With Everyone NOT Just Women: Flirting’s initial phase is playful and non-sexual, serving as a general tool for connecting and entertaining people. Practicing with everyone helps warm up the playful "muscle" and increases success with desirable women.
The F Formula: Phases (I.E.I.) and Goals
The F Formula progresses through three linear phases: Initiation (Cold), Escalation (Warm), and Infatuation (HOT). A man must ascend these phases in order to avoid being a Perv. However, once a phase is reached, the man should bounce back and forth between previous phases to maintain unpredictability and ramp up attraction.
In each phase, four sequential goals (A, B, C, D) must be achieved to ensure the woman is ready to escalate:
Goal
Description
Type of Force
Goal A
Correctly and clearly display your intent
Active Force
Goal B
Create and Instill Trust
Passive Force
Goal C
Build and Create desire for you within her
Active Force
Goal D
Decode her female cues to see if she’s positively responding
Passive Force
Phase 1: Initiation (Cold)
This phase is about initial contact, assessment, and being playful and mysterious, but not overtly sexual.
• Goal A (Intent): Intent is displayed using Subtext (subtle nonverbal cues). Verbally, this is achieved through Banter, Teasing, and Challenging (BTC). BTC is playful and slightly sexual but avoids being overly direct, allowing women an easy opening to flirt back.
• Goal B (Trust): Trust is earned by achieving an Emotional Connection. This involves sharing vulnerability without shame, which women find charming, and using "We" statements to create a relational "bubble world".
• Goal C (Desire): Desire is generated by getting her to invest in the man. This is done using The Boomerang Technique at a high point in the conversation, where the man pulls away his attention and energy, prompting the woman to invest in winning him back; he then rewards her attention with renewed focus. Desire is also created using The Surprise Technique by pushing the envelope briefly (e.g., a momentary sexual comment or touch around the waist).
Phase 2: Escalation (Warm)
The focus shifts to increasing desire through heavier teasing and escalating sexual talk and touch.
• Goal A (Intent): Sexual Directness is introduced, but only a notch higher than Phase 1. The man can admit she is sexy (only once) or talk about a sexual subject (like tantric sex). Touch escalation involves skirting her more intimate areas, such as the hips or sides of the legs, but not touching them directly. The Triangle Technique (looking at left eye, right eye, lips, and back up to both eyes, followed by a smirk) is a powerful method to build sexual tension.
• Goal B (Trust): Trust is deepened using "But Seriously Though Moments," which transition the interaction from banter to deeper, personal, connection-oriented topics. "Callbacks," where the man references earlier jokes or events, deepen the connection and strengthen the unique bond.
• Goal C (Desire): Boomerang and Surprise techniques are used to keep her primal brain engaged, helping her escape her critical headspace. Bouncing between sexual and non-sexual talk is key to maintaining unpredictability.
Phase 3: Infatuation (HOT)
This phase involves becoming more directly sexual to build lasting attraction and solidify the man as a desirable partner.
• Goal A (Intent): Intent is strong, direct, and without hesitation. Verbal focus shifts to telling her exactly what he finds sexy or what he wants to do to her (often indirectly). If not already alone, the man must suggest moving to a private space, getting her on "Your Turf and Terms" (TNT) to display confidence by leading the location change.
• Goal B (Trust): Trust maintenance involves easing her reservations, particularly her fears about future regret or being taken advantage of. The NUMBER ONE rule after getting alone is to show restraint and avoid jumping on her immediately. Instead, the man should use the connection tools from earlier phases to balance the active forces of escalation with conversation, demonstrating restraint and certainty.
• Goal C (Desire): The man must make BOLD moves and avoid caution, as women view risk-taking as a powerful aphrodisiac. A useful technique is to Switch Up The Power Roles, playfully telling her that his urges to touch and say sexy things are uncontrollable because of her overwhelming sexiness ("It’s HER fault").
Decoding Cues (Goal D) and Connection
Throughout the I.E.I. progression, Goal D requires constant attention to her cues. If a woman pulls back, it signals either disinterest or that she needs more trust/connection from earlier goals. In Phase 3, if she tries to steer the conversation back into the nonsexual realm (e.g., shifts body position, breaks eye contact), she is politely communicating that she is not interested in escalating further at that moment.
Crucially, flirting alone will NOT get or keep the girl. While flirting generates temporary attraction (emotions/chemicals), this feeling must be coupled with connection. Without connection, a woman will associate the fun with the night itself, and she won’t trust the man, leading her to potentially flake when he tries to move forward.

Analogy: Think of the F Formula as constructing a skyscraper. The 6 Flirting Tools are the foundation and basic materials. The Goldilocks Zone is the perfect blueprint, ensuring the building is balanced—not too weak (Pal) or unstable (Perv). The I.E.I. Phases are the floors, which must be built sequentially. Goals A, B, and C are the necessary construction steps on each floor (displaying intent, building structural trust, and adding magnetic features), and Goal D is the continuous safety inspection, ensuring the structure is sound and she is ready for the next level before you proceed.`;
